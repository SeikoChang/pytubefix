00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,400
Welcome everyone. Today's video is not

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:09,200
just a list of tips. This is a full

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,599
transformation plan for your fluency in

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,799
2026.

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:18,000
It doesn't matter if you feel shy. It

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,760
doesn't matter if you've failed before.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,640
It doesn't matter if you don't have

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,640
someone to speak English with.

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,560
If you follow these steps the way I'm

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,720
about to explain

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:34,480
slowly, consistently with heart, you

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,920
will speak English fluently in 2026.

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,840
This is not a shortcut. This is the full

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:45,200
system for your brain, your mouth, your

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,120
confidence, and your daily routine.

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,000
Because learning English is not just

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,960
about speaking. It's about building a

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,160
new version of yourself. someone who can

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,760
communicate with the world. So whether

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,239
you're

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,399
a beginner who understands English but

22
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,559
can't speak,

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,320
a student who freezes when it's time to

24
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:11,040
talk, or a dreamer who wants to work,

25
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,799
live, or study in an English-speaking

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,040
country,

27
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,520
this video will give you everything you

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,600
need to finally speak fluent English in

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,880
2026.

30
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,759
And one more thing, this video will not

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,320
only change your English, it will change

32
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:32,000
your mindset, your habits, your daily

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,520
life, and most importantly, your

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,200
self-belief.

35
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,079
Because when you learn to speak a new

36
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,600
language, you also learn to become a new

37
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,759
person.

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,439
Before we begin, subscribe to the

39
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,600
channel.

40
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,960
Every video here is designed to improve

41
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,960
your English clearly and confidently.

42
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,560
Now, let's begin. Step one, fix the root

43
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,200
problem.

44
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,920
It's not your English. It's your

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,119
environment. Most people fail to speak

46
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,079
English not because their brain is weak,

47
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,560
but because their environment is wrong.

48
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:12,560
That's the root problem. And that's

49
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,760
where we must begin. Imagine this. You

50
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,800
want to grow a plant, but the soil is

51
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,400
dry. There's no sunlight, no water. Can

52
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,800
the plant grow? No. The same is true for

53
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,480
your English. You want to grow your

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,599
fluency.

55
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,160
But your daily environment is full of

56
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,120
your native language, surrounded by

57
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,480
people who never speak English and built

58
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,280
with habits that avoid speaking. So, let

59
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,319
me ask you, are you reading in your

60
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,160
native language all day? Are you

61
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,720
thinking in your native language while

62
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,879
trying to speak English?

63
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,160
Are you waiting for English class but

64
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:57,200
not creating your own practice space?

65
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,040
If yes, that's the reason your fluency

66
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,360
is stuck.

67
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,720
You are trying to grow in the wrong

68
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,159
soil. The solution, change your English

69
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,319
environment. Starting today, fluency

70
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,640
doesn't begin with grammar. Fluency

71
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,360
begins with changing your surroundings.

72
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,720
Set your phone to English. Every time

73
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,640
you unlock your phone, see English, read

74
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,840
English, think in English. This trains

75
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,560
your brain without effort. Use English

76
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,200
while brushing, walking, cooking. You

77
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,760
don't need extra time. Just use normal

78
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,159
time in an English way.

79
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,239
Say your thoughts out loud in English.

80
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:42,640
I'm brushing my teeth. I'm feeling

81
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:45,440
sleepy today. I need to call my friend.

82
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,159
This builds thinking speed. Write one

83
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,959
page in English every morning. Don't

84
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:54,159
worry about grammar. Just write, even

85
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,680
simple. Today I want to speak better

86
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,400
English.

87
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,120
I feel nervous sometimes.

88
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,040
But I'm improving. Writing helps you

89
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,480
think clearly.

90
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,680
Clear thoughts equals clear speaking.

91
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,720
Start your day with English input for

92
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,079
the first 10 minutes after waking up. No

93
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,720
Instagram, no native language scrolling,

94
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,519
just one English video, podcast, or

95
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,639
voice note. Let English be the first

96
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:28,320
thing your brain hears every day. Put

97
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,240
English words on your mirror and wall. I

98
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,520
speak clearly.

99
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,919
I am improving every day.

100
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,639
English is easy. I just need to speak

101
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,199
it. Repeat these affirmations aloud

102
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,160
every time you see them. Your

103
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:47,040
environment will remind your brain.

104
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,080
We're serious now because the brain

105
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,120
learns from repetition and exposure.

106
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,440
The more you hear English, see English,

107
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,360
and feel English,

108
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,960
the more your brain accepts it as

109
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,600
normal.

110
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:06,000
Right now, English feels like a second

111
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:08,080
language to you. Your goal in 2026 is to

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
make it feel like your first language in

113
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,919
your environment.

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,720
Even if no one around you speaks

115
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,720
English, you can build a world where

116
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,639
English lives.

117
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,800
Wake up. Play a 5-minute English audio.

118
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,440
While brushing teeth, speak two

119
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,320
sentences about your day. Breakfast

120
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,759
time. Watch five minutes of an English

121
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,600
story or interview. Writing journal, one

122
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:37,199
page in English.

123
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,240
What I want to improve. Before sleeping,

124
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:44,080
record a two-minute voice note. What I

125
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,880
did today in English. Total time less

126
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,000
than 30 minutes. But your mind will feel

127
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,720
like you're living in an

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,600
English-speaking country. You don't have

129
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,240
to move to America. You have to bring

130
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,520
English into your home, your habits, and

131
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,160
your thoughts. Fluency is not about how

132
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,039
smart you are. It's about how consistent

133
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:09,680
your environment is. So before we move

134
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:12,800
to grammar, speaking, vocabulary,

135
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,680
fix this first. Where is English in your

136
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,400
daily life? If the answer is nowhere,

137
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,800
then start today. You can't grow fluent

138
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,160
English in a dry land. Change your

139
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:28,319
environment and you change everything.

140
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:31,759
Step two, don't just learn words. Train

141
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,400
your mouth to speak. You can know 10,000

142
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,479
English words in your brain but still

143
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,240
not be able to speak one full sentence

144
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,840
fluently.

145
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:45,199
Why? Because your mouth is not trained.

146
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,600
Your brain might be full of English, but

147
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,280
your mouth is still in your native

148
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,400
language.

149
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,560
This is the biggest difference between

150
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,600
learners who understand English but

151
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,880
can't speak and learners who speak

152
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:03,680
fluently even with simple vocabulary.

153
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,880
Most people spend their time watching

154
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,400
videos, reading books, listening to

155
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,720
podcasts, memorizing vocabulary,

156
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,880
learning grammar rules.

157
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,440
All of this helps your brain understand

158
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,360
English, but it doesn't help your mouth

159
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,800
produce English.

160
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:26,319
Speaking is a physical skill just like

161
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,160
dancing, swimming, or playing guitar.

162
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,120
You don't become a good dancer by

163
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,160
reading dance books. You don't become a

164
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,599
swimmer by watching swimming videos.

165
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:40,560
You become good by moving your body. The

166
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:43,280
same is true for English speaking. You

167
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,000
don't speak fluently by knowing English.

168
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:50,240
You speak fluently by moving your mouth

169
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,599
again and again and again. Your lips,

170
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,360
tongue, throat, and breathing patterns

171
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,319
are all trained for your native

172
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,800
language. For years, your mouth has

173
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,639
practiced your first language. So, it

174
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,120
feels comfortable, fast, easy. But when

175
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:11,520
you try to speak English, your mouth

176
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:15,199
freezes, hesitates, feels uncomfortable,

177
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:18,240
can't find the rhythm or pronunciation.

178
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,879
That's not your fault. It's not because

179
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,039
you're bad at English. It's because your

180
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,000
mouth has no muscle memory in English

181
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,199
yet. Your muscles don't know how to move

182
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,399
in the English way. That's why your

183
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:35,039
thoughts feel stuck because the bridge

184
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,959
between your brain and your mouth is

185
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:41,680
weak. The solution, just like going to

186
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:45,600
the gym, you must start doing mouth

187
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:49,040
workouts every day. Not with grammar,

188
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:52,480
not with writing, but with real speaking

189
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,240
drills, the shadowing method. Speak with

190
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,760
the video.

191
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,519
This is one of the most powerful

192
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,560
exercises in the world for spoken

193
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:04,399
English. Choose any video with a native

194
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:08,320
English speaker. Start with easy ones.

195
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:11,920
Stories, TED talks, short interviews.

196
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,560
Play one sentence. Pause.

197
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,680
Speak the sentence out loud. Then play

198
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,080
it again. And this time, speak with the

199
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,440
speaker matching their speed,

200
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,839
pronunciation, emotion, and rhythm. Do

201
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,720
this with one minute clips, then 2

202
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,959
minute clips, then longer. At first,

203
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,760
your mouth will struggle. You'll feel

204
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:37,040
slow. You'll mispronounce. You'll get

205
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,680
tired. That's okay. That means your

206
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,160
mouth is learning a new skill, like

207
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,880
lifting a new weight.

208
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,920
The more you shadow, the more your mouth

209
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:51,120
becomes fluent, fast, and natural in

210
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,880
English. Repeat each sentence five to 10

211
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,920
times if needed.

212
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,760
This is not a race. This is

213
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,440
transformation.

214
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,560
The 321 speaking drill. Speed, pressure,

215
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,880
clarity. This is a fluency exercise to

216
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,320
help you speak under time pressure. Just

217
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,000
like in real life, pick a simple topic.

218
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,839
For example,

219
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,480
my morning routine, my favorite movie,

220
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,519
why I want to learn English. Speak about

221
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,880
that topic for 3 minutes. No stopping,

222
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,200
no translation. Just keep going. Then

223
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,160
speak about the same topic again, but

224
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,519
this time for two minutes. Then again

225
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,720
for one minute. Each time you are

226
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:40,399
training, faster thinking, clearer

227
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,640
speaking, better structure. At first, it

228
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,600
will feel difficult. You might run out

229
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,880
of words. You might repeat yourself.

230
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,079
That's okay. Do this drill daily. And

231
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:55,600
after two weeks, you will notice fewer

232
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:58,560
pauses, faster sentences, stronger

233
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,240
confidence. This is the real gym of

234
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,680
fluency.

235
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:07,600
And no one can do it for you. Mirror

236
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:10,560
talk. Daily self-speaking habit. Every

237
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,360
night, just for 5 minutes, go to the

238
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,720
mirror and speak to yourself in English.

239
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,279
You can talk about what you did today,

240
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:23,519
what you're thinking about, what you're

241
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:24,959
planning tomorrow, how you feel. It

242
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,680
doesn't matter if your English is

243
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,839
broken. It doesn't matter if you repeat

244
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,600
the same words.

245
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,480
You are training your mouth and your

246
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,800
brain to work together. This is where

247
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,680
fluency begins.

248
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,519
Look into your own eyes. Speak your

249
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,360
truth in English.

250
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:47,120
Speak slowly, honestly, confidently.

251
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,600
This also builds your emotional

252
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,839
confidence because when you can speak to

253
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,519
yourself, you are no longer afraid of

254
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,839
speaking to others. Record yourself once

255
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,640
a week. Most learners are afraid to hear

256
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:04,560
their voice. But this fear is blocking

257
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:06,959
your growth. Choose a topic. Speak for

258
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,880
two to three minutes in English, record

259
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:14,560
it, then listen to it the next day. Ask

260
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,720
yourself, where did I pause? Where did I

261
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,160
make grammar mistakes? Did I sound

262
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:23,120
confident? Did I speak clearly?

263
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,279
This is how you become your own coach.

264
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,320
No one else has to correct you. You will

265
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:31,040
hear your mistakes. You will fix them.

266
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,680
And week by week, your voice will become

267
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,639
stronger. Your speaking will become more

268
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,639
natural. Fluent speaking is not about

269
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:44,240
knowing more. It's about saying more.

270
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:46,160
out loud every day. You can know

271
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,440
everything about English, but if your

272
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,240
mouth is silent, you will never feel

273
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,000
fluent. But if you train your mouth like

274
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,880
this, even with basic vocabulary,

275
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,399
you will feel confidence, clarity, and

276
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,800
control.

277
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:06,160
That is fluency.

278
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:09,760
5 minutes shadowing with a short video.

279
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:14,079
3 minutes mirror talk about your day.

280
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:16,720
3 to 2:1 drill on a simple topic.

281
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:20,079
Weekly recording every Sunday. That's

282
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,320
it. You don't need long hours. You just

283
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,600
need daily movement of your mouth with

284
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,399
English. This will give you the fluency

285
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,480
that grammar books can't.

286
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:34,480
This will give you the voice you're

287
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,320
dreaming of. Step three, build brain

288
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,880
fluency.

289
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,720
Train your mind to think in English.

290
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,120
If your brain is still thinking in your

291
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,600
native language, then speaking English

292
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,120
will always feel slow, broken, and

293
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,320
unnatural.

294
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:53,680
You will always translate in your head,

295
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,000
forget words, pause between sentences,

296
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,399
feel nervous when speaking. This is why

297
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,079
many learners say, "I understand

298
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,800
English, but I can't speak. I freeze

299
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:08,800
when I have to talk. I know the

300
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,680
sentence, but it doesn't come out.

301
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,480
These are not speaking problems. These

302
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,519
are thinking problems. Because the real

303
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,279
battle is not in your tongue. It's in

304
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,079
your thoughts.

305
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:25,839
Brain fluency means your thoughts flow

306
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,360
in English automatically, clearly, and

307
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,240
emotionally.

308
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,040
You're not stopping to translate. You're

309
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,680
not switching between languages. You're

310
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,079
not struggling to find words.

311
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,959
English becomes the default voice inside

312
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:44,639
your mind. That's what true fluency

313
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:47,519
feels like. And in this step, I will

314
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,399
show you exactly how to train it. Even

315
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:53,600
if you're a complete beginner, most

316
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:56,720
people never build brain fluency because

317
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:00,320
they were never taught how. Schools and

318
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:03,279
YouTube videos only teach vocabulary,

319
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,079
grammar, phrases, listening, and

320
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,800
reading. But no one teaches you how to

321
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,880
think in English. No one shows you how

322
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,199
to rewire your mind from your native

323
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,000
language to English.

324
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:19,279
So learners do everything.

325
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,399
Except the one thing that matters most,

326
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:24,880
practicing thoughts in English. That's

327
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,920
why they feel stuck. That's why they

328
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:31,279
feel like English is always foreign. But

329
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:34,800
we're about to change that. Your goal is

330
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:37,839
simple. to build an English operating

331
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,959
system inside your brain just like your

332
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,720
phone runs on Android or iOS.

333
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,920
Your thoughts run on your language

334
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,000
system. Right now, your brain runs on

335
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,600
your native language.

336
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,759
We will now install a parallel system

337
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,519
where your brain can think in English

338
00:15:53,759 --> 00:16:00,160
without effort. This is possible.

339
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:03,440
Millions have done it. And if you follow

340
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,959
this process, so will you. Let's now go

341
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,839
deep into the three tools that will

342
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:11,279
rewire your brain to think in English

343
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:14,320
fast, clear, and emotionally.

344
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:16,959
Tool one, the English thought loop.

345
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,120
Train the flow of thoughts. They speak

346
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:24,320
in broken parts.

347
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:26,880
I want to eat something good.

348
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,120
They don't speak in a flow.

349
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,680
Why? Because they never trained their

350
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,720
brain to complete thoughts in English.

351
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,279
So, we fix it with thought loops. Pick a

352
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,279
simple sentence and then extend it using

353
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,120
your thoughts.

354
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,600
Example,

355
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:47,199
I'm feeling tired because I didn't sleep

356
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,600
well and I was watching a video and then

357
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:52,880
I scrolled Instagram

358
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,040
and now I have to finish my work. See

359
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,600
the flow? That's how you speak in your

360
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,240
native language. full thoughts, not

361
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:05,600
isolated words. Now train that same

362
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:07,520
habit in English. Start with I like I

363
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,799
like coffee alanat especially in the

364
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:15,679
morning with milk and I usually drink

365
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:18,880
two cups before 9:00 a.m. or I don't

366
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:22,720
know. I don't know what to wear today.

367
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,880
Maybe jeans or something more formal. I

368
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,959
think it might rain.

369
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,880
Practice these flows for five minutes

370
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:34,640
every day. Don't stop, don't edit, don't

371
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,640
translate, just think and speak.

372
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:41,280
This builds the natural rhythm of

373
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:44,320
English inside your brain. Tool two, the

374
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,280
no translation zones. Force your brain

375
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,679
to think in English. If you want to

376
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,919
think in English, you must create

377
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,960
situations where translation is not

378
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,480
allowed. These are your no translation

379
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,240
zones.

380
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,840
Small moments where you train your brain

381
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,679
to use only English. Choose one to two

382
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,799
simple daily activities and promise

383
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:10,880
yourself in this moment I will think

384
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:14,320
only in English. Even if it's broken,

385
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:17,039
even if it's slow. Start small. Brushing

386
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:20,080
teeth. Taking a shower. Making tea.

387
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:24,480
Getting dressed. Like I'm brushing this

388
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:27,360
side. Now the front. Okay, done. I look

389
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:31,360
sleepy. This shirt is blue. Should I

390
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:34,400
wear this or something else? H the

391
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:37,360
grammar doesn't matter. What matters is

392
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,640
this. You are building the habit of

393
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:44,080
English thoughts. After one week, add

394
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:47,039
more zones. Grocery shopping, cooking,

395
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,679
going for a walk, waiting for a bus.

396
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:52,799
Eventually, your whole day becomes

397
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:55,919
English friendly and your brain stops

398
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:58,880
using translation as a crutch.

399
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:02,960
Tool three, the emotion connection

400
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:05,039
method. Attach English to your feelings.

401
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,600
Your brain remembers language faster

402
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,840
when it's connected to emotion. Think

403
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,000
about your native language. You didn't

404
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:15,039
learn it by memorizing grammar. You

405
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,880
learned it through hunger.

406
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,360
I want food.

407
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:23,919
Pain, it hurts.

408
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:26,640
Joy, I'm happy. Anger, leave me alone.

409
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,400
These were real life emotions

410
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,720
and they gave real power to your

411
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,760
language. You must do the same with

412
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,720
English. How? Start giving voice to your

413
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,520
feelings in English. When you feel

414
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,240
excited, say, "This is amazing."

415
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,600
Frustrated, say, "I'm really tired of

416
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:49,600
this." Nervous? Say, "Why do I feel so

417
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:52,160
scared?" Proud. Say, "I did it." I'm

418
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,440
proud of myself. Even if you say it

419
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:58,000
alone, even if you whisper, even if you

420
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,799
say it in your mind, this trains your

421
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
brain to use English in real emotion.

422
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,679
And that's when fluency becomes natural

423
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,840
because fluency is not just about

424
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,799
grammar. It's about connecting your

425
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:15,919
thoughts and feelings to English in real

426
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:17,440
time. Pick a topic. Dream, food, friend,

427
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,320
weekend.

428
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,720
Think about it for 2 minutes only in

429
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,679
English. Speak it out loud in full

430
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,679
thoughts. Not perfect sentences, just

431
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,799
flowing ideas.

432
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:34,559
Write five feelings you had today and

433
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:37,039
describe why in English. Create two no

434
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:40,080
translation zones for your day, like

435
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:43,440
brushing teeth or making tea. Before

436
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:46,720
bed, speak three positive affirmations.

437
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:51,120
I'm becoming fluent. English is part of

438
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:54,159
me. My brain is learning fast.

439
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,960
This is mental gym for fluency. Do it

440
00:20:54,159 --> 00:21:00,320
daily and your mind will stop thinking

441
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:03,360
in your native language and start living

442
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:06,400
in English. You don't have to speak

443
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,120
perfect English to be fluent. You just

444
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,799
need to think clearly and confidently in

445
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,360
English.

446
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:16,159
When your brain thinks in English,

447
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:19,360
speaking becomes automatic. When your

448
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:22,720
brain flows in English, words come

449
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:25,600
faster. Sentences come smoother.

450
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:29,200
Confidence becomes real. So don't just

451
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,679
train your mouth. Don't just read books.

452
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,799
Train your thoughts. Train your inner

453
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:38,000
voice. Make English the language of your

454
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:41,679
mind and fluency will follow you

455
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,679
everywhere. Step four, master the power

456
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:47,360
of repetition.

457
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:50,080
Speak less new, speak more deep. Most

458
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,080
learners are addicted to new. But

459
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,960
fluency comes from repeating the same

460
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,520
things until they become part of you. In

461
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:01,120
today's world, we have unlimited access

462
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:04,080
to new English videos, new vocabulary

463
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,799
apps, new grammar hacks, new YouTube

464
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,840
channels, new reals, podcasts, and

465
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:12,799
teachers. Every day you're chasing the

466
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:15,520
next tip, the next trick, the next

467
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,919
method. But your brain is not hungry for

468
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,600
new information. It's hungry for

469
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,679
repetition.

470
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:25,200
Because repetition is how your brain

471
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,679
says this is important.

472
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,280
When you hear something once, your brain

473
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:35,360
says interesting. When you hear it

474
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:37,840
again, it says I've heard this before.

475
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:41,840
When you hear it 20 times and say it out

476
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:44,080
loud. Okay, this is important. I will

477
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,720
remember this forever.

478
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,840
That's how memory works. That's how

479
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,240
fluency works. You didn't learn your

480
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,280
native language by learning 100 new

481
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,919
words every day. You learned by hearing

482
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,640
the same few words and phrases 10,000

483
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:03,280
times. You learned by repeating what

484
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,520
others said. You learned by living

485
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,480
inside repetition.

486
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:12,000
The golden rule of repetition. Repeat

487
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,480
one lesson 10 times, not 10 lessons one

488
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,720
time. That one rule can change

489
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:20,640
everything because most people touch

490
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:23,679
everything. but master nothing. They

491
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,320
watch a video once, write a word once,

492
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:29,679
practice a sentence once, shadow once,

493
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:32,240
and move on. Then they say, "Why can't I

494
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,799
speak clearly?" Because the sentence

495
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:38,240
didn't become part of you yet. You just

496
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:41,840
touched it. You didn't own it. Repeat

497
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:44,640
sentences, not words. Vocabulary is

498
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,120
important. But words alone don't give

499
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,880
fluency. You can know the word

500
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,720
opportunity,

501
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,600
but if you don't know how to use it in a

502
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,120
sentence, it's useless. That's why in

503
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,159
2026,

504
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:01,039
focus on sentence repetition. Instead of

505
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,520
memorizing the word opportunity,

506
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:06,400
memorize and repeat.

507
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:09,360
This is a great opportunity.

508
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,480
I don't want to miss this opportunity.

509
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,720
She gave me an opportunity to learn. Now

510
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:18,000
use these in speaking, writing, mirror

511
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:21,760
practice. Say each of them 10 to 20

512
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,720
times. Make them automatic. Because when

513
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:27,200
your brain remembers full sentences, you

514
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,640
don't have to think when speaking. You

515
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:34,240
just speak. Build a personal sentence

516
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:37,600
bank. Create your own sentence bank, not

517
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:40,559
just a vocabulary list. Every time you

518
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,159
hear a powerful sentence or phrase,

519
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:45,279
write it down.

520
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:47,600
Review it every day. Pick one to two

521
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:51,600
sentences and repeat them out loud 20

522
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:54,559
times. Use them in your journal. Use

523
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,559
them in mirror talk. Use them in your

524
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,559
voice recordings.

525
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,440
This is how those sentences enter your

526
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,120
mouth, your memory, and your fluency

527
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,600
system.

528
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,320
If you collect two sentences a day,

529
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:11,600
you'll have 60 new usable sentences a

530
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,760
month. But more importantly,

531
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:18,880
you'll have deeply repeated confidence

532
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:22,000
patterns. Use the 5x speaking method,

533
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,880
internal repetition system.

534
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,320
Take one sentence.

535
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:31,200
I'm not comfortable with this.

536
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,240
Repeat it out loud five times in your

537
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,720
normal voice. Repeat it five times

538
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,960
slowly and emotionally.

539
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,760
Feel the tone. Say it like you're

540
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:45,520
talking to a friend. Repeat it five

541
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:48,880
times in different moods. Angry, happy,

542
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:51,840
tired, professional, casual. Use it in

543
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,640
three different imaginary conversations.

544
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,039
Write a small paragraph using it. This

545
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,840
is repetition that works. This is

546
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:02,960
repetition that transforms. This is how

547
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,880
your brain says, "Okay, I know this. I

548
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,600
can use it anytime."

549
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,240
Watch one video 10 times. The deep

550
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:13,120
learning rule. Choose one English

551
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,799
learning video, not 10. Watch it 10

552
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,760
times. First time, just listen. Second

553
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:22,720
time, read subtitles. Third time, repeat

554
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:26,000
phrases. Fourth time, shadow every

555
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:29,279
sentence. Fifth time, pause and explain

556
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,159
in your own words. Sixth time, write a

557
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,640
summary. Seventh time, teach it to

558
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:38,320
someone or a mirror.

559
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:42,080
Eighth time, copy the speaking style.

560
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:45,039
Ninth time, speak about your opinion.

561
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,840
10th time, use sentences from the video

562
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:50,080
in your own life. Most people would skip

563
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,440
to a new video after the second watch.

564
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,600
But you, you are not most people. You

565
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,320
are training like a fluent speaker. And

566
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:02,000
fluent people don't rush. They repeat

567
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:04,240
deeply. Return to the basics

568
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,679
again and again.

569
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:10,400
You know the sentence, how are you? But

570
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:14,159
how many different ways can you answer?

571
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,960
I'm fine. I'm okay. I've been better.

572
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:19,600
Not too bad. Actually, I'm a bit

573
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,080
stressed. These are simple, but they're

574
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:25,120
powerful. Don't be ashamed of repeating

575
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,919
basic things. Repetition of basics is

576
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:31,679
how great speakers are born. Even native

577
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:34,880
speakers say, "I don't know. It's okay.

578
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:37,120
Let me think." That's a good point.

579
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,400
These are used 100 times more than

580
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:43,760
complex words. So, repeat them, master

581
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:46,720
them, own them. If you follow everything

582
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:50,240
in this step for just one month, you'll

583
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:53,279
notice your sentences come out faster.

584
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:56,799
Your confidence increases. You hesitate

585
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:59,440
less. You sound more natural. You stop

586
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:01,919
translating. You stop searching for new

587
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,039
videos because the old ones still teach

588
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,200
you.

589
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,600
And most importantly,

590
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,480
you begin to feel

591
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,679
this is not a foreign language anymore.

592
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,159
This is part of who I am. That's the

593
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,159
magic of deep repetition.

594
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:22,799
Pick two sentences from your sentence

595
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:25,039
bank. Repeat each 10 to 20 times. Use

596
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,919
each in speaking, writing, and mirror

597
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:30,799
talk. Shadow one minute of a video five

598
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,559
times. Review yesterday's sentence and

599
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:36,240
repeat it again.

600
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:38,559
Repeat this every single day. Fluency is

601
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,520
not about doing more. It's about going

602
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:44,720
deeper. And repetition is the deepest

603
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:47,520
learning you'll ever do. Fluency is not

604
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,559
about speed. It's not about memorizing

605
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:53,200
thousands of things. Fluency is about

606
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:56,080
repeating a few powerful things until

607
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:59,360
they become part of you. So stop

608
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:03,120
chasing. Start mastering. Repeat with

609
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:05,600
intensity. Repeat with love. Repeat like

610
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:09,520
your future depends on it. Because it

611
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:12,399
does. And when 2026 ends, you'll look

612
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:15,919
back and realize, "I didn't become

613
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:18,799
fluent because I knew more. I became

614
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:22,320
fluent because I repeated better." Step

615
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:25,279
five, practice speaking.

616
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,760
Even if you're completely alone,

617
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,960
you don't need a speaking partner. You

618
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,360
don't need to move to an

619
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,240
English-speaking country. You don't even

620
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:37,039
need a classroom or a tutor to become

621
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:40,640
fluent in English. What you truly need

622
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:43,840
is a system that makes you speak every

623
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,880
day, a mindset that doesn't wait for

624
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,440
permission, and a strategy that turns

625
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,080
silence into progress.

626
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,559
This step is for those who feel alone,

627
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:57,200
who feel forgotten, who feel like the

628
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:59,520
world isn't giving them a chance. And

629
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:03,679
I'm going to prove to you, you don't

630
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:06,399
need the world. You just need yourself.

631
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:09,279
Most learners never speak fluently, even

632
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:13,200
after years of studying, because they

633
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:16,080
wait for someone else. They wait for a

634
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:19,279
native speaker to talk to, a perfect

635
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:22,320
tutor, an English-speaking environment,

636
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:25,440
a job interview, a class or partner or

637
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,760
moment that may never come. And every

638
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,880
day they wait, their confidence dies a

639
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:33,440
little more. Their voice becomes weaker.

640
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:37,200
Their dreams move farther. Their heart

641
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,799
gets quieter because they believe I'm

642
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,200
alone.

643
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:44,000
So I can't practice.

644
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,480
But that belief is a lie. And once you

645
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,720
understand that, your fluency journey

646
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,720
becomes unstoppable.

647
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:54,159
Most fluent English speakers you see

648
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,000
today, even those on YouTube or stage,

649
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:59,440
spend hundreds of hours practicing

650
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:03,120
alone, in front of mirrors, whispering

651
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:06,320
in bed, talking to walls, repeating

652
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:09,200
sentences on walks, speaking out loud to

653
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:12,320
themselves in empty rooms. They weren't

654
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,799
lucky. They were determined. They didn't

655
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,640
wait for a partner. They became their

656
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:19,200
own partner.

657
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,760
This is what we call solo speaking

658
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,240
mastery and it is one of the most

659
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:28,080
powerful secrets of fluency.

660
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:31,200
Your goal is to speak English out loud

661
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:34,480
every single day with no partner, no

662
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,960
fear, and no excuses. We will build your

663
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:41,039
private speaking world. A world where

664
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,360
you think in English, speak in English,

665
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:45,120
express your emotions, practice real

666
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,880
life conversations,

667
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:51,120
build deep fluency alone. These are the

668
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:55,120
five systems that will turn your silence

669
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:57,519
into fluency. Pillar one, mirror talk

670
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,720
therapy. The most powerful speaking

671
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:03,200
habit. Your mirror is the most honest

672
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,000
speaking partner in the world. It

673
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,000
doesn't laugh. It doesn't interrupt. It

674
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,120
doesn't correct you, but it reflects

675
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,480
your energy, your voice, your fear, and

676
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:17,039
your growth. Stand in front of a mirror.

677
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:20,799
Look yourself in the eye. Pick one

678
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:22,559
topic. Your day, your goals, your

679
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:26,000
feelings.

680
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:29,200
Speak for five minutes without stopping

681
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:34,080
out loud. Don't worry about grammar or

682
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:36,799
vocabulary. Just express why it works.

683
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,399
You face your fear of speaking. You

684
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:41,600
build confidence through visual

685
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:44,640
feedback. You stop being scared of your

686
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,960
own voice. You start owning the language

687
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:50,720
with your full body.

688
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,480
This is not silly. This is how actors,

689
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,600
speakers, and leaders train their

690
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,480
confidence. And if you do it daily, you

691
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:02,960
will start to believe I have a voice in

692
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:06,240
English and I trust it. Pillar two,

693
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,880
imaginary conversations. The roleplay

694
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,960
power. If you don't have someone to talk

695
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:15,039
to, create them. Seriously, your brain

696
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,840
doesn't need another human to simulate

697
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:19,600
speaking. It just needs intention and

698
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,640
imagination.

699
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,440
Imagine a situation. Job interview,

700
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,080
ordering food, meeting a friend, airport

701
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,919
check-in. Create both sides of the

702
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:37,039
conversation. Speak it out loud. React.

703
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:38,640
Pause. Smile. Ask. Answer. Example. Hi,

704
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,960
I'd like to order a large coffee,

705
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,320
please. Sure. Would you like milk or

706
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,880
sugar with that? Milk? No sugar. And

707
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,279
also one blueberry muffin. All right.

708
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,919
Your total is $5.

709
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:54,399
You're practicing flow, rhythm, sentence

710
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:58,320
structure, pronunciation, listening, and

711
00:33:54,399 --> 00:34:01,760
confidence all by yourself.

712
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:04,880
Why it works. You prepare for real life

713
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:08,000
situations. You train your reflexes and

714
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:11,040
emotional tone. You become comfortable

715
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,399
with common dialogues. Do this every day

716
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,399
with one new situation. Within 30 days,

717
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:20,240
you will feel ready for any conversation

718
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:22,639
in the real world. Pillar three, topic

719
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:27,359
talks. Master your voice on real

720
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:30,399
subjects. Pick a topic. Set a timer.

721
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,919
Speak. This is called topic talk

722
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,520
practice.

723
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,599
You don't need anyone to ask you

724
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,240
questions. You don't need anyone to

725
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:41,599
listen. You are speaking to improve your

726
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:45,599
organization, your ideas, your fluency.

727
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:48,320
Choose one topic each day. My dream job,

728
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:52,240
the best day of my life, my biggest

729
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:54,560
fear. Why I want to learn English. What

730
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,040
I would change about the world. Set a

731
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:00,240
timer for 3 minutes. speak without

732
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:03,200
stopping. Even if you get stuck, say,

733
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:06,720
"Um, let me think." What I'm trying to

734
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:09,520
say is that's still English. That's

735
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:13,119
still fluency. That's how real people

736
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,440
speak. Over time, you'll stop pausing.

737
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,240
You'll stop struggling. You'll start

738
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:21,599
speaking like a storyteller. Pillar

739
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:24,560
four, voice journaling. Your daily

740
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,960
speaking diary. Writing journals is

741
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,720
great, but speaking journals are next

742
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:33,119
level. Every night before bed, instead

743
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,839
of writing, record yourself speaking

744
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:39,040
about your day. Open a voice recorder

745
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:42,560
app. Speak freely for 2 to 5 minutes,

746
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:46,240
what you did, how you felt, what you

747
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:49,920
learned, what you want to improve. Save

748
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:52,160
the recording. Repeat this every night.

749
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,560
Then once a week, listen to one to two

750
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,720
of your old recordings.

751
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:00,400
You will cry with pride when you

752
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:02,160
realize, "I sound better than last week.

753
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,680
I sound like someone who speaks

754
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,640
English."

755
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,119
This is not just fluency training. This

756
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,119
is emotional healing.

757
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:15,200
You're recording the voice of a person

758
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:17,200
who refused to give up. Pillar five,

759
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,680
shadow conversations.

760
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,680
Copy, speak, own.

761
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,560
You've seen this before, but let's use

762
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,960
it only for solo fluency. Now, use any

763
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,359
video with English speakers, movies,

764
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:33,280
interviews, audio books. Listen to a

765
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:37,520
sentence. Pause. Repeat it exactly. Same

766
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:40,880
tone, rhythm, speed, emotion. Repeat

767
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:43,839
again and again until your mouth owns

768
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,400
it. Do this with one minute of video per

769
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:48,320
day. By the end of the week, your voice

770
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,880
will start to sound more natural,

771
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,280
confident, and nativeike.

772
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,400
This is how you train intonation,

773
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,240
confidence, emotional tone, and rhythm

774
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,160
all alone.

775
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,040
Let's talk about the emotional side.

776
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,520
Now, this is the part most fluency

777
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,720
coaches never talk about. Here's what

778
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,320
you may feel. I feel silly talking to a

779
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,000
mirror.

780
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,599
I feel weird pretending to have a

781
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,240
conversation.

782
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:20,560
What if someone hears me? This doesn't

783
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:22,560
feel real. Talking alone is not crazy.

784
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,520
It's courageous.

785
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,359
Every master talks to themselves.

786
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:32,160
You just don't see them when they're

787
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:35,839
doing it. Singers rehearse lyrics alone.

788
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:38,160
Actors repeat scenes in their bedroom.

789
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:41,520
Speakers practice their speech to an

790
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:44,160
empty wall. You're not crazy. You're a

791
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,560
warrior. You're rewiring your brain,

792
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:49,920
your voice, your identity with no

793
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:53,359
audience, no applause, no support.

794
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:56,640
That's not weird. That's heroic. Your

795
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:58,240
alone practice is not fake. It's real

796
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,880
preparation.

797
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,359
Every time you speak alone, you're

798
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,920
building mouth memory. You're building

799
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:09,440
courage. You're training your brain to

800
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:12,720
react faster in real life. So when a

801
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:15,520
real conversation happens, your mouth

802
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:19,280
doesn't freeze, your voice doesn't

803
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:22,320
shake, your thoughts don't disappear.

804
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,720
You've already trained for it. Speaking

805
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,320
alone is how you build unbreakable

806
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,880
confidence.

807
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:32,079
The truth is, if you can speak to

808
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,960
yourself confidently in English, you can

809
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,880
speak to anyone in the world because

810
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,680
you've already faced the fear of being

811
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,160
judged. You've already practiced without

812
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,640
praise. You've already chosen to believe

813
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:48,240
in yourself when no one else was

814
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,880
watching. That kind of fluency,

815
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,680
no teacher can give it to you. No

816
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,200
classroom can replace it. It's born in

817
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,000
silence,

818
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,200
built in your room, and carried in your

819
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,280
heart. Stop saying, "I can't practice

820
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,599
because I'm alone."

821
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,839
Start saying, "I speak fluently because

822
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,760
I practice alone.

823
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:12,640
You are not weak because you have no

824
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:15,440
partner. You are strong because you keep

825
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:19,119
going without one. So talk to your

826
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:21,040
mirror. Speak to your phone. Create your

827
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:25,119
own conversations.

828
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:28,000
Voice your emotions. Repeat your truths.

829
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:30,480
Because the voice you build in private

830
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,640
will one day speak on stages, in

831
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:38,400
interviews, in relationships, in dreams.

832
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:41,200
Step six, speak like a human, not like a

833
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,920
textbook. Why do some English learners

834
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:47,200
speak perfectly but sound boring,

835
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,440
robotic, and awkward? You've heard them.

836
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,680
Their grammar is perfect. Their

837
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,720
vocabulary is advanced. Their

838
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:58,880
pronunciation is technically correct.

839
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:03,200
And yet, something feels wrong. Their

840
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,960
English feels cold, empty, uncomfortable

841
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,359
because they're not speaking like a

842
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,880
person. They're speaking like a grammar

843
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:11,599
machine.

844
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,240
Now, think about this. You've also seen

845
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:16,560
people who make grammar mistakes, who

846
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:19,599
don't use big words.

847
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:23,599
But when they speak, you feel something.

848
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:26,400
You listen, you smile, you connect.

849
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:28,079
That's the difference. That's the goal

850
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,240
of this step.

851
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,400
to help you sound real, natural, and

852
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:35,839
emotionally fluent, even if your English

853
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,960
is simple. Let's be honest. Memorize

854
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:41,839
grammar rules. Translate perfectly.

855
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:45,040
Speak like a textbook. Use correct

856
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:47,359
English. They never teach you. How to

857
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,960
express emotion. How to sound like

858
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:54,000
yourself. How to be real in English. How

859
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,640
to sound like someone people trust. This

860
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,079
is why learners say things like, "I feel

861
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,599
fake when I speak. I sound nervous, not

862
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,839
natural.

863
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:07,280
People understand me, but they don't

864
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:10,319
connect with me." This is a deep pain

865
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:14,319
and a silent one. Because on paper,

866
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:16,319
everything looks fine. But in real life,

867
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:18,800
you don't feel fluent. You feel

868
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:22,079
uncomfortable. That's not fluency.

869
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,440
That's performance. Now, let's fix that

870
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,760
forever.

871
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:29,200
When you speak your native language, you

872
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:31,680
use pauses. You express emotions. You

873
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,079
change your voice with your mood. You

874
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:37,839
don't always speak full sentences. You

875
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:42,079
sometimes say, "Uh h

876
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:45,359
yeah, that's what makes you feel human.

877
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:48,400
It's not about speaking correctly. It's

878
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:50,960
about speaking with soul." And in

879
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,599
English, you must build the same

880
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,720
freedom. Your goal is to feel like

881
00:41:53,599 --> 00:42:01,680
yourself in English. To speak in a way

882
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:05,680
that sounds confident, calm, casual,

883
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:08,079
clear, emotionally alive, to make people

884
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,960
feel something when you speak, not just

885
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:13,040
understand your words. We'll now learn

886
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,240
five transformational techniques to help

887
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:18,079
you get there. And each one will change

888
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:21,920
the way you feel when you open your

889
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:25,680
mouth in English. Technique one.

890
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:28,560
Speak in chunks, not single words.

891
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,680
You've been told to memorize vocabulary,

892
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:33,599
but human beings don't speak in words.

893
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,319
We speak in groups of words that go

894
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:39,520
together naturally. These are called

895
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:43,599
chunks. Let me show you the difference.

896
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:48,480
Robotic speech, word by word. I will and

897
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:51,760
go to the store after I finish work.

898
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:55,040
Human speech chunked. I'll go to the

899
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:57,760
store after work. See the flow. Chunks

900
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:00,319
are how natives speak naturally. You

901
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,000
know what I mean? It depends on the

902
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:04,720
situation.

903
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I'm not really sure. Let me get back to

904
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,880
you. To be honest, these are the real

905
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,119
muscles of spoken English. When you

906
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,319
learn English in chunks, you don't need

907
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:20,720
to build sentences word by word. You

908
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:23,280
just plug in a chunk and flow continues.

909
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:26,240
Watch native speakers, interviews,

910
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:29,119
movies, podcasts. Don't focus on

911
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:32,480
vocabulary. Focus on what phrases they

912
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:36,160
repeat. Write those phrases down. Repeat

913
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:38,880
them out loud 10 to 20 times. Use them

914
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,119
in your mirror talk and voice journal.

915
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,079
The more chunks you own, the more

916
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:46,560
natural and automatic you sound. This is

917
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:50,319
how you stop sounding robotic. You start

918
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:53,440
sounding real. Technique two, speak with

919
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:56,880
emotion, not just logic. Robotic

920
00:43:53,440 --> 00:44:00,160
speakers focus only on grammar. Say

921
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:03,280
everything flat. Use no tone or feeling.

922
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:05,680
Human speakers smile when happy. Lower

923
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,000
their voice when serious. Pause when

924
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,560
they feel something. Use emotion to

925
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,280
guide the message. Same sentence,

926
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:16,880
different delivery. I can't believe it.

927
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:20,480
Robotic version. I can't believe it.

928
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:24,160
Flat. Boring. Human version. I can't

929
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:29,359
believe it. Surprised. I can't believe

930
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:31,839
it. Sad. Gh. I can't believe it. Angry.

931
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:33,680
Same words, different emotional energy,

932
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:36,880
completely different feeling. That is

933
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:39,760
how humans communicate. So ask yourself,

934
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,480
am I just saying words or am I saying

935
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,200
feelings? Choose one sentence from a

936
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:48,800
video or show. Say it in five different

937
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:52,560
emotions. Record yourself. Listen back.

938
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:55,760
Adjust tone, speed, volume, pauses.

939
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:58,240
Repeat until it feels real. This is how

940
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,880
you train emotional delivery. When you

941
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:04,400
speak like this, people will say your

942
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:07,040
English is not only clear, it's alive.

943
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:10,720
That's fluency of the soul. Technique

944
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:12,240
three. Stop chasing perfection. Chase

945
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,160
connection.

946
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:17,200
This might be the most important lesson

947
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:20,800
of your life. Perfect English doesn't

948
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:24,079
make people listen. Honest, simple human

949
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:27,040
English does. Let go of fear of

950
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:29,760
mistakes, fear of judgment, fear of

951
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:33,599
grammar errors because native speakers

952
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:36,480
make mistakes, too. They say, um, they

953
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:39,920
change sentences halfway. They start and

954
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:42,560
restart. They forget words but they keep

955
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:46,000
speaking because their focus is not

956
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:49,359
perfection. Their focus is connection.

957
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,680
Speak slowly, clearly, and honestly.

958
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:55,359
Make eye contact even with yourself in

959
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:58,240
the mirror. Use your hands to explain.

960
00:45:55,359 --> 00:46:00,640
Use pauses to let the words breathe.

961
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:03,760
Say, "I don't know the word, but let me

962
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:06,720
explain." And keep going. This is

963
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:08,720
confidence, not grammar, not vocabulary,

964
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:12,800
but courage to keep speaking like a

965
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:16,319
human. Technique four, use everyday

966
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:19,040
expressions, not academic English.

967
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:22,160
Don't say, I find this experience to be

968
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:25,839
quite pleasurable and beneficial.

969
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:29,359
Say, I really liked it. It was fun and

970
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:31,520
helpful. Use normal words. Use how you

971
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:34,640
speak in your language, in your real

972
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,800
life. and match that energy in English.

973
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:40,560
Native speakers use basic language every

974
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:44,800
day. You got to be kidding me. Come on.

975
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:46,720
Seriously? No way. That's awesome. These

976
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:50,000
are expressions full of emotion,

977
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:53,599
attitude, and voice. Learn one per day.

978
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,440
Repeat it. Use it. Live it. This is what

979
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:59,200
makes your English sound alive, not

980
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:02,480
academic. Technique five, match your

981
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:05,359
body language with your voice. Spoken

982
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:10,400
language is not just your mouth. It's

983
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:13,920
your eyes, face, shoulders, hands,

984
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:16,960
posture, breath. If your body is closed,

985
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:19,680
tense, stiff, your English will feel

986
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,599
blocked. But when you move, when you

987
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:25,520
open your chest, when you breathe

988
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:29,359
deeply, your voice becomes powerful,

989
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:31,280
confident, fluid. That's why public

990
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:34,880
speakers, actors, and leaders train

991
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:38,480
their body, not just their words. So,

992
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:41,200
stand tall, speak with your hands, smile

993
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:44,000
when appropriate, breathe while you

994
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:46,560
speak. This is how you bring your full

995
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,119
presence into English. People don't

996
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:52,079
remember the grammar you use. They

997
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:54,240
remember how you made them feel, how

998
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:57,040
confident you looked, how clearly you

999
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:59,359
spoke, how real you sounded. So stop

1000
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:02,560
hiding behind textbooks. Stop trying to

1001
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:06,160
be perfect. Start being yourself in

1002
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:09,520
English. Speak with real emotions, real

1003
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:11,839
tone, real rhythm, real soul, and watch

1004
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:14,560
how the world responds.

1005
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:18,000
Because when you speak like a human,

1006
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:21,359
people listen like humans too. Fluency

1007
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,559
is not a skill you learn. It is a person

1008
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:27,359
you become. A person who is patient with

1009
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:30,480
themselves, is brave enough to speak

1010
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:33,200
imperfectly, is consistent even without

1011
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:36,160
motivation, is emotionally connected to

1012
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:40,240
the language, is no longer waiting for

1013
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:41,839
permission. So in 2026, make this

1014
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,960
promise.

1015
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:47,920
I will not quit English because of fear.

1016
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:50,960
I will not quit because of mistakes.

1017
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:54,079
I will not quit because of slow days.

1018
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:58,240
I will not quit because of comparison.

1019
00:48:54,079 --> 00:49:01,280
I will stay and I will become fluent.

1020
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:03,280
And if you do that one day, without

1021
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,800
realizing it, you'll speak English

1022
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,760
naturally.

1023
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:11,559
Not because you forced it, but because

1024
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,559
it became you.
