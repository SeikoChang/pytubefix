to clean it.

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,920

>> and maybe vacuum the bedroom, too.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,079
Yes, but only the bedroom. The bathroom

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,519
Can I help you?

>> Okay. Should I cut them small or big?

57
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,040
>> Cut them into small pieces. They'll cook

58
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,280
faster.

59
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,280

Should I put the vegetables in?

64
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:07,519
>> Not yet. Wait for the water to boil.

65
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:10,319
>> Mom, can we add noodles, too?

66
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,200
>> Yes, but only a little.

67
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:18,280
>> Should I wash the lettuce now?

68
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,280
Yes. Wash it well and cut the tomatoes.

69
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,080
I love cooking with you, Mom.

70
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,640
>> I'm happy you enjoy it. Cooking together

72
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,920

187
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,440
>> 2 or 3 days.

188
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:32,880
Great. I need it for school next week.

189
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,959
>> Don't worry. You will get it in time.

190
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,320
>> Thank you for helping me.

191
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:41,519
>> You're welcome. We're sorry again.

192
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,839
>> It's okay. Have a nice day.

193
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,839
>> You too.

194
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,800
>> Visiting the dentist.

195
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,640
How are you feeling today?

196
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,640
>> My tooth hurts a lot.

197
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,080
>> Which tooth hurts?

198
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,240
>> The one on the left at the back.

199
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,680
>> Okay, please open your mouth. I'll take

200
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,680
a look.

201
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,680
>> Sure.

202
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,399
Does it look bad? It looks like you have

203
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,720
a small hole in your tooth. I will clean

204
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,839
your tooth first.

205
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,320
Oh no. Will it hurt?

206
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,240
>> Don't worry. I'll give you something for

207
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,000
the pain.

208
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:38,160
>> Okay, that sounds better. After that, I

209
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,640
will fill it. How long will it take?

210
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,839
>> Only about 15 minutes.

211
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,399
>> Good. I have work later.

212
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,200
>> It will be fine. After the treatment,

213
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,600
avoid eating for 1 hour.

214
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,480
>> Can I drink water?

215
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:58,160
Yes, but drink slowly.

216
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,800
>> Thank you, doctor. I'm a bit nervous.

217
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,480
>> It's normal to feel nervous. I will be

218
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,200
gentle.

219
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:09,160
>> Thank you. Let's start.

220
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,160
>> All right. Please relax.

221
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,440
My stomach hurts.

222
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,200
Doctor, my stomach hurts a lot.

223
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,600
>> Where does it hurt?

224
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,680
>> On the lower right side. It's a really

225
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,640
sharp pain.

226
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,040
>> How long have you had this pain?

227
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,320
>> Since last night. It got worse this

228
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,519
morning.

229
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,160
>> Do you feel sick or have a fever?

230
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,399
>> Yes, I feel a little sick and my

231
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,160
temperature is high.

232
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,320
>> I see. It could be your appendix.

233
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,880
>> Is it serious?

234
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,360
>> It can be serious if we don't treat it.

235
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,360
We need to check quickly.

236
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,600
>> What will you do?

237
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,120
>> First, we will do a scan and a blood

238
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,880
test.

239
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,360
>> And after that,

240
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,680
>> if it's your appendix, you may have a

241
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,680
small operation.

242
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:14,240
>> I'm scared.

243
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,399
>> It's okay. The surgery is fast and safe.

244
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,279
Many people have it.

245
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,240
>> Will I need to stay in the hospital?

246
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:25,120
>> Yes, maybe one or two days.

247
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,360
>> All right. Thank you for helping me.

248
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,519
>> You're welcome. We will take good care

249
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,519
of you.

250
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,720
>> Get ready for a trip.

251
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,880
Sweetie, are you sure you're ready for

252
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:50,240
this trip? Totally, Mom. I've got my

253
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,920
swimsuit, my Converse, and a good

254
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,399
playlist.

255
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,160
A playlist is nice, but what about

256
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,800
sunscreen?

257
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,920
I'll just grab some when I get there.

258
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,079
Oh, like last year in Florida.

259
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,079
Mom,

260
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:09,279
you spent the whole second day looking

261
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,760
like a boiled lobster.

262
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,440
Just only that time.

263
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,519
And you couldn't even wear your cute

264
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,959
dress for dinner.

265
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,959
Okay. Okay, I'll get it now.

266
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:27,040
Good. Now, first aid kit. Mom, it's just

267
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,519
a weekend at the beach. Not a big

268
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,040
adventure in the jungle.

269
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,880
Really?

270
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,360
My friend Linda went to California

271
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,760
without one. got stung by a jellyfish

272
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,639
and had to pour vinegar from a beach

273
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:45,200
cafe on her leg.

274
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:48,880
Ew, that sounds painful and smelly.

275
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:52,120
It worked though, so pack the kit. Got

276
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,120
it, ma'am.

277
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,160
in the hotel.

278
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:09,120
[music] Anna, come here. Look at that

279
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:13,800
smoke detector. What about it? There's a

280
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,800
tiny lens inside the smoke detector.

281
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,040
You're serious?

282
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,000
Dead serious. I checked with my phone's

283
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:25,120
flashlight. This is real.

284
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,040
Okay, but let's just get another room.

285
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,920
No drama.

286
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,600
No, Anna. This is serious.

287
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,680
How could they let someone place a

288
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,279
camera here without checking security

289
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,800
carefully?

290
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,399
They need to give us more than just a

291
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:45,399
room charge. Fine, but let's keep it

292
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,399
polite. We're not here to start a war.

293
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,760
Hello. [music] We just found a hidden

294
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:56,560
camera inside the smoke detector in our

295
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:59,760
room. Oh my goodness. I am so so sorry

296
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:03,120
you had to go through this. I completely

297
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:06,399
understand how alarming this must be.

298
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,480
This is a serious violation of privacy.

299
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:12,399
We should get a full refund and a free

300
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,240
stay. I understand your concern. We will

301
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,680
remove the device immediately and check

302
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,519
it out. All right, Sharon. They didn't

303
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,480
want something bad like this to happen

304
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:25,040
either. We just want a safe room and

305
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,279
something to make up for the trouble.

306
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,760
Absolutely. I can move you to one of our

307
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,560
premium suites right away, free of

308
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,320
charge. Our security team will doublech

309
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,839
checkck the entire room before you

310
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,279
enter.

311
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,040
And I'll be happy to give you both a

312
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,800
dinner voucher for tonight at our

313
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:45,240
restaurant.

314
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,240
Thank you. That's very kind.

315
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,360
Anna, keep your bag in front of you.

316
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,199
Seriously, I'm just taking a picture of

317
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,120
the ocean.

318
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:08,000
And that's when thieves attack while

319
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,880
you're busy taking pretty pictures.

320
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,240
You sound like my grandma. All right,

321
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,240
I'll keep an eye on my bag. Yep, that's

322
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,399
what you should do.

323
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,839
Hey, let's go to that beach bar over

324
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,839
there. All right.

325
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:28,320
[music]

326
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,320
Oh, you know that song from K-pop Demon

327
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,639
Hunter 2?

328
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:36,639
Yes. I love it. The melody is so catchy.

329
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,040
And with the waves crashing while this

330
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,360
song plays, it just makes everything

331
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,839
feel relaxed.

332
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,920
Yeah. I love how the song and the beach

333
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,240
go together.

334
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,120
Some things did happen, but honestly,

335
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,440
they just add to the memories.

336
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,639
True. Maybe next time we'll have even

337
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,880
crazier stories to laugh about. But for

338
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,880
now, let's just enjoy the sunset and the

339
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,880
soda.

340
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,400
Cooking leftovers in the fridge.

341
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,640
Well, Zoe, your mom's gone for the

342
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:22,079
weekend. Looks like it's just you and me

343
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:26,319
for dinner tonight.

344
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:29,039
And the fridge looks kind of sad, Dad.

345
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:33,280
There's one box of leftover rice, half

346
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:36,880
an onion, and two eggs. True. We'll fill

347
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:41,440
it up tomorrow. I promise. And I'm so

348
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,120
hungry now. So, what do we do?

349
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,640
Better make something with what we've

350
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,160
got.

351
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:51,440
I'm thinking of egg fried rice.

352
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,720
>> Egg fried rice? I've only seen mom make

353
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,919
that.

354
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,919
>> Well, tonight you'll see dad make it dad

355
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,919
style.

356
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,320
You cut really fast.

357
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,080
Years a practice, buddy. You'll get

358
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:11,039
there. I can break the eggs.

359
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:14,440
>> Go for it. But no shells. Okay.

360
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,440
I'll try.

361
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:21,039
See, Dad, perfect.

362
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:23,200
>> I'm proud of you, my helper. We'll add a

363
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,200
little seasoning to the eggs and whisk

364
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,320
them.

365
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,440
Then, we heat the pan, right? That's

366
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:34,960
right. You've got the process. Pour in

367
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,039
the eggs first and stir gently. Then,

368
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,600
push the eggs to the side and add the

369
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,600
leftover rice.

370
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,640
Wa! It looks just like mom's.

371
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,480
Thanks, buddy. Cooking together makes it

372
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,360
taste better.

373
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,360
Next time, can we make pizza?

374
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,280
>> Sure, but you're still doing the dishes

375
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,679
tonight.

376
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,679
Wait, what?

377
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,880
Cooking on a rainy day?

378
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,600
You know, babe, this reminds me of the

379
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,280
time in our tiny apartment with no

380
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,520
heater.

381
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,559
>> Oh, yes. You were stirring soup [music]

382
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:23,600
with two jackets on.

383
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:26,640
>> And you kept saying, "This is romantic."

384
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,960
Even when we were freezing, the soup

385
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,240
saved us that day, just like this one

386
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,240
will.

387
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,320
>> At least now the stove works and our

388
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,760
socks are dry.

389
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:40,000
Yeah, and the kitchen feels so warm.

390
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,960
Looks like the soup's almost ready. Let

391
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,600
me help you set the table.

392
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,480
>> Be careful, babe. It's hot.

393
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,600
>> Don't worry, I've got it.

394
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,600
>> M smells amazing.

395
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,600
You know what? I'm actually thankful for

396
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,919
the rain today.

397
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,840
>> Thankful most of the time. You complain

398
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,559
when it rains.

399
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:05,679
True, but this rain made me remember the

400
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:08,080
old days in our tiny apartment. We

401
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:11,200
didn't have much, but we had each other,

402
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:14,000
and that made everything feel warmer.

403
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,919
>> Yeah. Even when life was tough, we still

404
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,640
found ways to laugh.

405
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,720
>> And now we get to enjoy this soup in a

406
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,080
warm kitchen and a roof that doesn't

407
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,960
leak.

408
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,960
>> That's what I call progress.

409
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,840
the new neighbor.

410
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,000
Hey, I think you dropped your wallet

411
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,960
back there.

412
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,120
>> Oh, there's a sticker on the wallet.

413
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,960
That's really mine.

414
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,799
Thank you so much. I didn't even notice

415
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,120
it was missing.

416
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:54,000
>> No problem. I was just walking behind

417
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,880
you and saw it on the ground.

418
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,720
>> You're very kind. What's your name?

419
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:04,320
>> I'm Tom. I live in apartment 305, kind

420
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,960
of near here. How about you?

421
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:10,240
>> Wow, that's so close. I'm in apartment

422
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,360
302. I'm Anna. I just moved in last

423
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,520
week.

424
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,320
>> Wait, didn't we bump into each other at

425
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:20,559
the elevator that day?

426
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:23,600
>> Oh my gosh, yes, I remember now.

427
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,760
I was carrying so many things.

428
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,280
Yeah, and you look like you could use a

429
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,919
hand.

430
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,440
>> Thank you again. That was very kind of

431
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:34,400
you.

432
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,559
>> No problem. We're neighbors. If you

433
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,320
want, I can show you some good places

434
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:41,880
nearby.

435
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,880
>> That would be great.

436
00:21:43,465 --> 00:21:49,480
[music]

437
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,480
>> Welcome to the singing club.

438
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,720
Hey, you must be the new voice here,

439
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,679
right?

440
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,120
>> Yes. This is my first day here. I'm

441
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,080
Jack.

442
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,320
>> Welcome, Jack. I'm Emma, the club

443
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,240
founder, and this is Lily, our club

444
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,080
event organizer.

445
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,080
Let me start by telling you about our

446
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,159
club's traditions.

447
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,240
Every month, we have a surprise singing

448
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:22,000
contest.

449
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,960
Surprise contest? What do you mean?

450
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,880
>> Yeah, no practice allowed.

451
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,960
They pick a song and you have to sing it

452
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,520
on the spot.

453
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,159
Last month I had to sing a rap song and

454
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:39,120
I barely knew the words.

455
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:41,679
>> That sounds scary, but also kind of fun.

456
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,320
>> It is. It keeps us on our toes and makes

457
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,559
every meeting exciting.

458
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:52,440
Plus, no one cares if you mess up. We

459
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:52,440
just laugh and cheer. Okay, I'm in

460
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,919
the gym.

461
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:14,240
Wow, you lift weights like a superhero.

462
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,320
Thanks. But I'm not a superhero. I just

463
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,840
practice a lot.

464
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:23,600
I'm Mike. This is my first week here. My

465
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:26,960
muscles already hurt. Welcome, Mike. I'm

466
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,640
John. The pain means your body's getting

467
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,679
stronger.

468
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,760
I hope so, but I'm afraid my body will

469
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,400
hurt tomorrow.

470
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,880
That happens to everyone.

471
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,799
Here's a tip. Don't try to live too much

472
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,440
at first.

473
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:46,480
But I want to look cool.

474
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,919
It's better to be safe than sorry.

475
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:52,799
What's your secret to lift so well? No

476
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,480
secret. I drink a lot of water and train

477
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,679
regularly.

478
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,200
That sounds good. Can you teach me some

479
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,840
tips?

480
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,080
Sure. If you work hard, I'll buy you a

481
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,720
protein shake.

482
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:10,480
Great. Thank you. I'm happy to have a

483
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:13,720
gym friend. Me, too. The gym's more fun

484
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,720
with friends.

485
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,679
Who's doing the dishes?

486
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,000
Nina, the sink is full. You should do

487
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:32,720
the dishes.

488
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,600
Why me? I cook dinner. So, I set the

489
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,960
table. That's part of dinner, too. I

490
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:42,080
even made garlic bread as a side dish.

491
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,320
At least rinse this one. Not touching

492
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,360
anything in that sink. I can still smell

493
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:50,400
the garlic. Then enjoy the smell all

494
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,799
night. I'm not doing it either.

495
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:56,240
>> What's all the noise?

496
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:59,120
>> She cooked, but now she won't clean. I

497
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:02,159
cooked. She sat on TikTok.

498
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,480
>> All right, girls. I have a solution.

499
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,720
Whoever finishes the dishes, wipes the

500
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,039
table, and makes the kitchen look clean

501
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,799
gets $20.

502
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:14,559
>> For real?

503
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:16,640
Yeah, the whole $20 goes to the winner.

504
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,240
>> I want that cute hoodie we saw at the

505
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,480
mall.

506
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,600
And I want to buy that tabletop standing

507
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,120
mirror for my room. It's 50% off right

508
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,760
now.

509
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,760
>> Well, I think you two should do rock,

510
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,000
paper, scissors.

511
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:36,240
>> Let's play three rounds. The winner gets

512
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,240
two. You always say that when you lose.

513
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,240
>> Fight.

514
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:50,960
again. That's not fair.

515
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:54,400
Move over. I've got $20 coming my way.

516
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:57,279
>> Wait, one more thing. Mom just texted.

517
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,640
She's on her way home in 10 minutes.

518
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,640
>> Uh-oh.

519
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,200
>> If she walks in and sees garlic plates

520
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,120
in the sink, I'm telling you, no one's

521
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,559
getting anything.

522
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,400
>> What?

523
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,600
I'll dry the dishes and you'll wash.

524
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:15,799
Problem solved. All right, fine. I can

525
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,799
share $10 with you.

526
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,039
Babysitting little sister.

527
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,919
>> All right, boys. I need to visit

528
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,159
grandma.

529
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,520
You two look after your little sister.

530
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,000
All right.

531
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:37,279
>> It's just 2 hours, right, Mom?

532
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,760
>> If the train's on time. Yes, but if this

533
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:42,320
rain gets any worse, you'll be standin

534
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,320
parents for four

535
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,960
4 hours.

536
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,279
Don't be so dramatic.

537
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:53,919
Just remember two things. Don't let her

538
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:56,480
climb the table. And never, never change

539
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,159
her nappy near the fan.

540
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,960
>> Why not?

541
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:03,919
>> Try it once and you'll understand.

542
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,880
>> And if she starts crying,

543
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:09,600
>> cuddle her. turn on cartoons or come up

544
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,799
with a silly game. Just don't give her

545
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,520
crayons again. The living room wall is

546
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:18,720
still purple thanks to you two.

547
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,159
>> That was Tom's idea. But you agreed,

548
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,080
too.

549
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:26,720
>> Anyway, one last thing. If Lucy gets too

550
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,039
quiet, that's your warning.

551
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,440
>> Oh, why? Mom.

552
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:36,000
>> Silence means something's up. Always

553
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:38,960
check where she is. So, noise is good

554
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,960
>> with a toddler. Absolutely.

555
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,840
Noise means she's not climbing on the

556
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:47,279
table or drawing on the sofa.

557
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:50,480
>> Got it, Mom. Keep her loud and happy.

558
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:52,720
>> Exactly. And boys, try to survive

559
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:56,600
without arguing.

560
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,600
>> No promises, Mom.

561
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,279
>> Wrong turns.

562
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:11,039
Dad, we just passed that flock of cows

563
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,760
for the third time.

564
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:16,080
>> The Wi-Fi is gone. My hands are cramping

565
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,480
up from not gaming.

566
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:22,640
>> Maybe we should actually follow the GPS

567
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,320
this time. GPS recalculating route

568
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,279
again.

569
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:31,200
>> Technology hates me. I was born to read

570
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:33,440
paper maps. Can we stop at the bakery?

571
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,240
I swear the croissant is calling my

572
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,600
name. We'll get snacks once we're on the

573
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,679
right road.

574
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,240
>> We were on the right road. You just

575
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,399
thought it looked too boring.

576
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,159
>> We get snacks once we're on the right

577
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:49,600
road.

578
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:53,520
>> Come on. We're making memories here.

579
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,679
>> GPS. Turn left at the next vineyard. If

580
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,120
another cow across the road, I'm taking

581
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:01,360
the wheel. Dad, do we even know where we

582
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:05,279
are right now?

583
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:07,919
>> Uh, somewhere near a lot of grapes.

584
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:10,720
Are we in a horror movie now?

585
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:14,480
>> Your mom texted me. She said we were 10

586
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:18,080
minutes away 40 minutes ago. Probably

587
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:21,760
baking that apple pie by now.

588
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:25,440
The whole village must smell like it.

589
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:28,960
>> Apple pie and Wi-Fi.

590
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,559
Fine. Fine. I'm turning the car around.

591
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,415
All of you are making me crave that

592
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:36,435
apple pie more than exploring this road.

593
00:29:34,415 --> 00:29:36,435
[music]

594
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,000
Fixing the faucet.

595
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,760
Uh, why is the water spraying

596
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,159
everywhere?

597
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,000
Must be a loose washer. It's under

598
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,720
control.

599
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,320
>> Dad, are you stuck?

600
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:01,279
Nope. Just dealing with the pipe. You

601
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,279
don't know how to fix it, do you? I'm

602
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:07,120
calling a plumber.

603
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:10,080
No, I got this. Who needs a plumber? I'm

604
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,880
just trying to remember some old skills.

605
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,200
Oh, you mean the how to replace a facet

606
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,919
for a beginner's video?

607
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,919
Silence, assistant. The master is at

608
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,919
work.

609
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,240
Done.

610
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,559
Wait, it's fixed.

611
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,600
I nailed it. All I needed was a wrench

612
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:36,159
and a 720p tutorial

613
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:39,600
and maybe some paper towels. The floor

614
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:43,000
is a swimming pool. Every victory comes

615
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,000
at a price.

616
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,000
Fixing the Wi-Fi.

617
00:30:52,480 --> 00:31:00,159
Mom, the Wi-Fi is down again.

618
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,480
Are you sure it's not your phone? I'm

619
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:06,000
sure. I checked everything. The whole

620
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:09,520
house has no connection. H. Did you

621
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,679
press something by mistake? No, I was

622
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:15,039
just walking downstairs when Tik Tok

623
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,720
suddenly froze. Oh no, a national

624
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,440
emergency.

625
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,080
Mom, I'm editing a video. People are

626
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,039
waiting to see it. I'm sure they'll

627
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:28,000
survive a few more minutes without it.

628
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:30,880
Anyway, maybe it's that blinking box

629
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,399
thing. What do you call it again? The

630
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:38,000
router. I'll reset it. Wait, don't blow

631
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:40,960
up the house. Okay, Mom. It's a router,

632
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,960
not a bomb. Still better safe than

633
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:47,440
sorry. Let me unplug it.

634
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:51,120
Whoops. It had lights. You're a tech

635
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:54,279
genius. All I did was unplug and plug it

636
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,279
back in.

637
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,847
>> One step at a time.

638
00:31:59,827 --> 00:32:01,847
[music]

639
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,960
>> How you feeling, babe?

640
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,399
>> Honestly, like my legs forgot how to

641
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,559
walk.

642
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:15,440
>> That bad, huh?

643
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,720
>> I swear my lungs gave up after five

644
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,000
minutes.

645
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,320
You did great, my girl. Really? First

646
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,640
days are always tough.

647
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,159
>> I don't know how you enjoy this. It's

648
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,120
torture.

649
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,840
>> It gets better. I promise. Your body

650
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:35,360
just needs time to adjust.

651
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:37,919
>> Time and maybe a new pair of legs.

652
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,200
>> You'll see. In a few weeks, you'll feel

653
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,240
stronger.

654
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,880
>> Do we have to run again tomorrow?

655
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,159
>> No rush. We'll go slow. Little by

656
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,320
little.

657
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,919
I thought couples go on cute coffee

658
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,880
dates,

659
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:55,760
not sweat in old sneakers.

660
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,960
>> This is a cute date. It's just cardio

661
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,120
style.

662
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,399
>> So, running really helps with health,

663
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,720
huh?

664
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:05,519
>> Yeah, it boosts your heart, clears your

665
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,559
mind, and builds strength.

666
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,960
>> Okay, I want the clear mind part. My job

667
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:13,600
has been crazy lately.

668
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,679
>> Then running might be perfect for you.

669
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,480
Just don't quit yet.

670
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,480
Fine, but next time can we jog and get

671
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,320
coffee after?

672
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:26,640
>> Deal. Running shoes first, latte second.

673
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,159
>> You better not run too fast. I'm

674
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:32,893
watching you.

675
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,893
>> I'll match your pace always. [music]

676
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,840
>> Morning exercise.

677
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,080
Mom. Dad,

678
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,799
I thought you two would be drinking tea

679
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,799
this early in the morning.

680
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:54,640
>> Hello, love birds.

681
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:56,880
>> Tea comes after the exercise, sweetie.

682
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,279
With morning exercises, you've got to

683
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,640
breathe deeply and get the body flowing

684
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:04,080
first.

685
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:07,360
>> We do this every morning. After a quick

686
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,839
session, the body feels light and the

687
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,720
mind feels clear.

688
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:14,639
Totally different from us. Every morning

689
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,879
we're [music] like zombies rushing out

690
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,040
the door half awake.

691
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:23,280
>> Now I get why your parents are still so

692
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:26,320
healthy and look so young, too.

693
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,879
That's the secret right there. Morning

694
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,119
exercises keep the blood flowing and the

695
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:33,679
skin glowing.

696
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:37,679
>> Just 20 minutes of lifting arms and legs

697
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:40,720
every morning and I feel great all day.

698
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,879
Then next week we'll join you. I want to

699
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,720
feel great like you, Dad.

700
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:47,359
>> And I wouldn't mind glowing skin like

701
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,839
mom either. Don't forget to wear

702
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:51,839
something stretchy, okay? And no

703
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:54,839
laughing when your dad starts doing deep

704
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,839
squats.

705
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,960
Don't forget to practice your English

706
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,839
