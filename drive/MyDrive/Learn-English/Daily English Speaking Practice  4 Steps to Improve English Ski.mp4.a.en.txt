>> Speak English.

14

>> Now we will have a three-part exercise.

15
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:57,360
Part one, listening practice.

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:01,840

Let's get started.

21
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:19,759
Part one, English listening practice.

22
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,840
In the first part, you'll listen to a

23
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,840
conversation between native English

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,840
speakers.

25
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,960
Try to focus on the meaning of the

26
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,119
conversation when you listen to it.

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,920
This will help you understand real life

28
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,920
conversations better.

29
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,240
Make or break.

30
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,040
>> Hey Mark, are you excited for the city

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,560
sports festival this weekend?

32
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,640
Yes, but I'm also a bit nervous.

33
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,560
Our team wants to win the basketball

34
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,600
game this year.

35
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,719
>> I heard the other teams are strong.

36
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,080
Do you think you have a good chance?

37
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,920
>> Maybe. The final game will make or break

38
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,000
our season.

39
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:19,040
If we win, we finish in first place.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,520
>> Wow, that sounds important.

41
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,920
Did you train a lot?

42
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,599
Yes, we practiced every evening after

43
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,160
work.

44
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,160
We worked on passing, shooting, and team

45
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,840
communication.

46
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,400
>> That's great. Teamwork is everything.

47
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,480
>> Are you ready for the pressure?

48
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,879
>> I think so.

49
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,200
When I play, I try to stay focused and

50
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,120
enjoy the game.

51
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,160
>> Good idea.

52
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,200
I'll come and watch you on Saturday.

53
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:55,319
>> Really? That means a lot.

54
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,319
I hope we make you proud.

55
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,640
Part two, learn vocabulary.

56
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,319
Now, let's explore some new words

57
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,720
together in our vocabulary section.

58
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,120
I'll explain a few words and use them in

59
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,480
example sentences to help you grasp

60
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,480
their meaning easily.

61
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,480
>> Vocabulary

62
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,760
Make or break

63
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,080
a situation that is very important. It

64
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,000
can bring success or failure.

65
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,400
>> Example,

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,319
this exam can make or break my future.

67
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,879
>> This will make or break you.

68
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:48,159
>> He could make or break us. It could make

69
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,319
or break second grade.

70
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,480
>> Pressure

71
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,480
stress or a heavy feeling because

72
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,640
something is difficult or important.

73
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,040
>> Example,

74
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,599
she feels a lot of pressure before the

75
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,799
big test.

76
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,720
>> Look, no pressure.

77
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,080
>> Pressure. No pressure.

78
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,720
>> Pressure's dropping.

79
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,560
>> That means a lot.

80
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,239
Something makes you feel happy,

81
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,840
thankful, or respected.

82
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:24,800
>> Example,

83
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:27,199
thanks for helping me. That means a lot.

84
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,840
>> Thanks. That means a lot.

85
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:33,199
>> That means a lot.

86
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,520
>> I want to remind you something, guys.

87
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,720
Repetition is very important to become

88
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,960
fluent in English.

89
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,199
So, watch this video many times.

90
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,120
Try to answer the questions out loud and

91
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,120
you will improve your speaking skills

92
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,120
quickly.

Part three. Listen and answer practice.

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,800
Time to practice speaking.

96
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,520
I will ask you questions about the

97
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,680
conversation.

98
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,919
Listen carefully and try to answer out

99
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,479
loud before I give the correct answer.

100
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:18,759
Don't be shy. Speaking practice is the

101
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,759
fastest way to improve your fluency.

102
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,280
Answer the questions out loud.

103
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,800
>> Hey Mark, are you excited for the city

104
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:34,400

Was Mark completely relaxed about the

113
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,639
game?

114
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,479

basketball.

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:16,400
He plays basketball with his team.

118
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:20,520
>> I heard the other teams are strong.

119
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,520
Do you think you have a good chance?

120
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,720
>> Did Lena hear that other teams are weak?

121
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:32,160
>> No, she didn't. She heard the other

122
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,520
teams are strong.

123
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,639
Maybe the final game will make or break

124
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,560
our season.

125
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,520
Does Mark think they have a chance to

If we win, we finish in first place.

When will they finish in first place?

134
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:19,440

We worked on passing, shooting, and team

146
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,560
communication.

>> Are you ready for the pressure?

155
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,479
>> I think so.

156
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,960
When I play, I try to stay focused and

enjoy the game.

158
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,240

hear one speaker's line. Listen

carefully, then say it out loud.

187
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,079
After that, read the other speaker's

188
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,279
line yourself. You'll take turns

189
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,920

>> If it's too fast, just pause or slow

191
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,600
down the video. Repeat this practice

192
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:30,519
often. Shadowing helps you speak more

193
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,519
clearly, naturally, and with confidence.

194
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:42,200
Hey Mark, are you excited for the city

195
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,200
sports festival this weekend?

196
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:56,519
I heard the other teams are strong.

197
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,519
Do you think you have a good chance?

198
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:12,519
Wow, that sounds important.

199
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,519
Did you train a lot?

200
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:27,079
That's great. Teamwork is everything.

201
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,079
Are you ready for the pressure?

202
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,920
Good idea.

203
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,920
I'll come and watch you on Saturday.

204
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,480
Yes, but I'm also a bit nervous.

205
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,959
Our team wants to win the basketball

206
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,959
game this year.

207
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,639
Maybe the final game will make or break

208
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:17,880
our season.

209
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,880
If we win, we finish in first place.

210
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,959
Yes, we practiced every evening after

211
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,519
work.

212
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,519
We worked on passing, shooting, and team

213
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,519
communication.

214
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,040
I think so.

215
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:46,600
When I play, I try to stay focused and

216
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,600
enjoy the game.

217
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:58,040
Really, that means a lot. I hope we make

218
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,040
you proud.

219
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,160
Great job today. Remember, the best way

220
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,680

speak.
