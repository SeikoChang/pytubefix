00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:10,159
year from the ground.

200
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:13,039
And no one talked about the grand

201
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:16,600
slapped heaven in the face and took hell

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:25,960
redheaded girl just trying to hold up

her chin.

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:38,240
Her oldest brother Ronnie was last to be

208
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:42,799
seen at the turn of a decade when he was

209
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:45,120
only 18. But a driver's drunken eyes and

210
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:47,679
foot to the floor

211
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,910
brought a kid down and grief through her

Death of a son on a weakarted man

silenced the games and toughened her

hands.

217
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:17,279
When she grew up, she painted her way to

218
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:20,080
a city in which she remained on the

219
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:22,159
frame.

220
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,880
And where they all embraced the grin

221
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:27,540
that slapped heaven in the face and took

222
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,200
hell for a spin.

they had a baby girl who put stars in

When the 80s came through her family,

she took all the from the nests and the

When she finally stopped taking the heat

239
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:32,480
it brought daddy to his knees and her

240
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:35,200
kids to their feet.
