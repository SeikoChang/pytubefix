[music]

98
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,319
Watching in slow motion

99
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,319
in my foolish [singing] lovers [music]

100
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,319
game.

101
00:06:44,794 --> 00:06:52,709
[music] In this endless motion, finally

102
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,709
lovers [singing] know no shame. [music]

103
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,824
Turning and returning to [music] some

104
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,844
secret place inside.

105
00:07:01,824 --> 00:07:03,844
[music]

106
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:13,280
Watching in slow motion

107
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:17,599
as you turn to me and say,

108
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,599
"Take my breath away. [music]

109
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,599
Take my breath away.

110
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,240
Take my breath away.

111
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,955
[music]

112
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,975
Take my breath away.

113
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:33,975
[music]

114
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,160
Watching I keep waiting. Still

115
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:43,160
anticipating [music and singing]

116
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,160
love.

117
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:53,400
Never hesitating [music]

118
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,400
to become a faded once.

119
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:03,080
Turning and [music and singing]

120
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:03,080
returning to some secret place inside.

121
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:13,000
watching in slow motion as you [music]

122
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
turn to [singing] me and say,

123
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,720
"Take my breath away.

124
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,680
Take [music] my breath away.

125
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,685
Take my breath away. [music]

126
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,080
Take my breath away.

127
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,039
Through the hourglass I saw you

128
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:43,350
[music and singing]

129
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,720
and time just slipped away.

130
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:48,591
[music]

131
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:51,839
When the mirror crashed, I called you

132
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:57,800
[music] and turned [singing] to hear you

133
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,800
say, "If only for today."

134
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,760
I am not [music] afraid.

135
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,800
Take my breath away.

136
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,760
Take [music] my breath away.

137
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,086
Take my breath away. [music]

138
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,240
Take my breath away.

139
00:09:25,271 --> 00:09:27,291
[music]

140
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,876
Take my breath away. [singing]

141
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:41,646
Take my breath away. [music]

142
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,666
Take my breath away.

143
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:43,666
[music]

144
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,661
[music]

145
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:07,901
[music]

146
00:10:13,742 --> 00:10:15,762
[music]

147
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:25,959
Come on baby, dry your eyes. [music]

148
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,959
Wipe your tears.

149
00:10:26,187 --> 00:10:32,160
[music]

150
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:36,440
I never like to see you cry. [music]

151
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,440
Won't you please forgive me?

152
00:10:37,977 --> 00:10:43,217
[music]

153
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,399
I would have never tried to hurt you.

154
00:10:43,217 --> 00:10:49,680
[music]

155
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:54,000
I just needed someone to hold me [music]

156
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:58,680
to fill the void. Will you were gone to

157
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,680
fill the space of [music] emptyness?

158
00:11:02,867 --> 00:11:07,120
[music]

159
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:12,092
I'm only human

160
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,092
of flesh and blood for me. [music]

161
00:11:15,312 --> 00:11:21,862
[music] human

162
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,882
born to make mistakes.

163
00:11:21,862 --> 00:11:23,882
[music]

164
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:33,120
So many nights I long to hold you.

165
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:36,399
So many [music] times I looked and saw

166
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,440
your face. Nothing [music] could change

167
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:44,133
the way I feel.

168
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,153
No one else could ever take your place.

169
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:46,153
[music]

170
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:55,978
I'm only human

171
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,978
of flesh and blood. I'm made [music]

172
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:05,800
human

173
00:12:00,508 --> 00:12:05,800
[music] born to make mistakes.

174
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,639
The tears I cry are in tears of pain.

175
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:14,240
[music]

176
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:16,959
They're only to hide my guilt and shame.

177
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,639
I forgive you now. I [music] ask the

178
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:24,120
same of you. While we were apart, I was

179
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,120
human, [music] too.

180
00:12:25,398 --> 00:12:27,418
[music]

181

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:43,738
I'm only [singing] human.

183
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:45,758
A flesh [music] and blood on me. Hum

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,273

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,000
find. Take it easy.

380
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:29,720
[singing]

381
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,720
Take it [music] easy.

382
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,679
Don't let [singing] the sound of your

383
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,480
own wheels [music]

384
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,480
make you crazy.

385
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:45,080
Come [singing] on, baby.

386
00:24:40,971 --> 00:24:45,080
[music] Don't say me.

387
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,452
I [music] got to know if your sweet love

388
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:54,679
is going to save [music]

389
00:24:51,452 --> 00:24:54,679
[singing] me.

390
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:56,747
[music]

391
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,039
Oo.

392
00:25:00,622 --> 00:25:02,642
[music]

393
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,640
Take it easy.

394
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,720
Take it easy.

395
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,320
Take it easy.

396
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:41,279
[bell and music]

397
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:43,197
Between the eyes of love, I call your

398
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,200
name.

399
00:25:43,197 --> 00:25:49,039
[music]

400
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,679
Behind those guarded [singing] walls, I

401
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,080
used [music]

402
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,080
to go

403
00:25:53,677 --> 00:26:02,000
[music] upon a summer wind.

404
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:05,467
There's a certain melody

405
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,320
takes me [music] back to the place

406
00:26:05,467 --> 00:26:10,360
[singing]

407
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,360
that I know.

408
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,840
On [music] the beach.

409
00:26:18,568 --> 00:26:25,640
[music] Down on the beach.

410
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,640
Down on the beach.

411
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,033
The secrets of the summer [music]

412
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,159
I will keep.

413
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,200
The son of [singing] time [music] will

414
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,760
blow

415
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,760
a mystery.

416
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:54,400
No [music and singing] one but you and I

417
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,480
underneath that moon and sky.

418
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:02,720
Take [music] me back [singing]

419
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:06,480
to the place that I know. [music]

420
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:10,368
On the beach.

421
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,368
There'll be [music]

422
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,279
down [singing]

423
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:18,600
on the beach.

424
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,600
There'll be

425
00:27:22,758 --> 00:27:24,778
[music]

426
00:27:31,929 --> 00:27:33,949
[music]

427
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:43,520
[music]

428
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:46,919
Forever in [singing] my dreams my heart

429
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,919
will [music] be

430
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:53,599
hanging [singing] on to Peace with a

431
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,599
memory. [music]

432
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,714
A day of strange desire.

433
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,320
A night that burned like fire.

434
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:06,559
[singing and music]

435
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,520
Take me back

436
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:12,520
to the place that [music] I [singing]

437
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,520
know

438
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,200
on the beach.

439
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,200
The [music and singing]

440
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,200
beach.

441
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:29,000
Down on the beach.

442
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,000
Down the beach.

443
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:33,679
Down [music and singing]

444
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:36,480
on the beach.

445
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,720
On the beach.

446
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,679
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [music]

447
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,679
On the beach.

448
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:57,789
[music]

449
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,340
[music]

450
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:10,080
Turn on my VC. Same one [music] I've had

451
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,799
for years. James Brown [singing] on the

452
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:16,159
Tammy show. Same tape I've had for

453
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:18,960
years. I sit [music] in my old car, same

454
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,880
one I've had for years. Old batteries

455
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,559
running down and [singing] ran for years

456
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:26,000
and years. [music]

457
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:28,159
Turn on the radio, the static hurts my

458
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
eyes. [singing] Tell me where I should

459
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:34,960
go. I been out in years. Turn on [music]

460
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,720
the stereo. It's played for years and

461
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:40,720
years. I know [music and singing] this

462
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:43,679
red song. It's all I own when the world

463
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,600
is running down. [singing]

464
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,559
You make the best of what's [music]

465
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:52,559
still around

466
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:54,799
and the world [singing] is running down.

467
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:57,799
You make the best of what's still

468
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,799
around.

469
00:29:57,995 --> 00:30:03,235
[music] Plug in my [singing] MCI to

470
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,520
exercise my brain. Make [music] records

471
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:07,039
[singing] on my own. Can't go out in the

472
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,919
rain.

473
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:13,039
Pick [music] up the telephone. I've been

474
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:15,760
here for years. No one to talk to me.

475
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:19,760
I've listened [singing] ears. When the

476
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:24,000
world is running down, [music] you make

477
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:26,160
the best of what's still around.

478
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,159
When [music] the world is running

479
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:30,100
[singing] down,

480
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,399
you make the best of what's still

481
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,399
[music] around.

482
00:30:37,951 --> 00:30:39,971
[music]

483
00:30:45,156 --> 00:30:47,176
[music]

484
00:30:49,741 --> 00:30:54,326
[music]

485
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:57,039
When I feel lonely here, don't waste my

486
00:30:54,326 --> 00:30:59,600
[singing] time with tears. I run deep

487
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:02,559
again. [music] And for years and years,

488
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:05,039
I don't like [singing] the food I eat.

489
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,919
The [music] cans are running out. Same

490
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,600
food for years and years. I the food I

491
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,640
eat. [singing and music] When the world

492
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,799
is running down,

493
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,360
you make the best of what's still

494
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:21,440
around.

495
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,960
When the world is running down,

496
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,320
you make [music and singing] the best of

497
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,386
what's still around.

498
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,399
When [music] the world is running

499
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:32,559
[singing] down,

500
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:34,991
you make the best of what's still

501
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,991
around. [music]

502
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:41,519
When the world is running down, [music]

503
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,519
you make the best of what's still

504
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,519
around.

505
00:31:44,761 --> 00:31:49,519
[music] Turn on [singing] my VCR. Same

506
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,320
one I've had for years. James [music]

507
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:56,360
Brown on the Tammy show. Same tape I've

508
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,360
had for years. For [singing] years,

509
00:31:59,827 --> 00:32:01,847
[music]

510
00:32:06,377 --> 00:32:08,397
[music]

511
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:18,840
to be bold [music] living [singing] on

512
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,840
the edge of life.

513
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,682
Our people [music]

514
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,702
running out of dreams in time.

515
00:32:26,682 --> 00:32:28,702
[music]

516
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:35,840
I can hear it when you tell me so.

517
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,480
I can [music and singing] feel it, but I

518
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:42,080
can't let go.

519
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:44,960
Two people got [music] to stick together

520
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:48,559
and love one [singing] another. Save it

521
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,799
for a rainy day. Some [music] people got

522
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:54,399

rainy day.

525
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,567
Two [music] people [singing]

526
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:12,587
living the way we do.

527
00:33:10,567 --> 00:33:12,587
[music]

528
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:20,840
Are people [singing]

529
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:20,840
trying to keep love a [music] new?

530
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:28,240
What is it to make some sense of it?

531
00:33:26,288 --> 00:33:30,880
[music] What to [singing] do to make the

532
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:34,720
feeling?

533
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:38,720
Two people got to stick together.

534
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,840

538
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:50,360
heart [singing and music] on a rainy

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,360

540
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:57,120
[music]

541
00:33:52,640 --> 00:34:01,360
I can [singing] run to your rescue.

542
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:05,840
You got to stand by [singing] me.

543
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:10,120
There's a lot of love between us.

544

We should [singing] never let go.

545
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,560
Two people got to stick

547
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,720

Saving it for a rainy day. So people got

549
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,188

550
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:31,188

551
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:38,480

552
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:43,440
We won't stay together. [music]

553
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,960
Two people shelter on a rain day. Two

554
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,200

555
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:53,720

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,960
Yeah.

[music]

564
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:25,920
If you want me to stay, I'll be around

565
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:29,839
today. [music] Be available [singing]

566
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,359
for you to see.

567
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:36,079
I'm [singing] about to [music]

568
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:40,240
go and then you know for me to stay

569
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:42,240
there I got to be me.

570
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:46,400
You'll [singing and music] never be in

571
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:49,040
doubt. That's what it's all about. You

572
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,520
can take [music] me for granted and

573
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,880
smile. [singing]

574
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:58,320
Count the days that I'm gone. Forget

575
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:02,079
reaching me by phone. I [music] promise

576
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:05,200
I'll be gone for a while.

577
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:08,560
And when you [music] see me again, I

578
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,640
hope that you have been the kind of

579
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,119
person that you really [music]

580
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,935
are [singing] now.

581
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:19,119
You got to get it straight. [music] How

582
00:36:15,935 --> 00:36:23,920
[singing] could I ever be late? You're

583
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:26,800
my woman taking up my time. [music]

584
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:30,720
How could I ever allow? [singing]

585
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:34,985
I guess I wonder how I could [music] get

586
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,985
out of pocket for fun. [singing]

587
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,640
When you know that you're never number

588
00:36:38,205 --> 00:36:46,680
[music and singing] two. Number one's

589
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,680
going to be number one. No,

590
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:54,560
I'll [singing] be good. I [music] wish I

591
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,545
could. I get this message over to you

592
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,565
now.

593
00:36:56,545 --> 00:36:58,565
[music]

594
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,080
[music]

595
00:37:12,265 --> 00:37:14,285
[music]

596
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:24,240
And when you see me [music] again, I

597
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:27,985
hope that [singing] you have been the

598
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,296
kind of person that you really are now.

599
00:37:27,985 --> 00:37:31,316
[singing]

600
00:37:29,296 --> 00:37:31,316
[music]

601
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,866
I'll be [singing] good.

602
00:37:35,846 --> 00:37:37,866
[music]

603
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,761
I wish I could.

604
00:37:41,741 --> 00:37:43,761
[music]

605
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:53,400
I get this message over to [singing] you

606
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,400
now. Now. Now.

607
00:37:54,186 --> 00:37:56,206
[music]

608
00:38:01,391 --> 00:38:03,411
[music]

609
00:38:05,976 --> 00:38:07,996
[music]

610
00:38:13,181 --> 00:38:17,111
[music]

611
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,480
Baby, I can figure it out. Your gaunt

612
00:38:17,111 --> 00:38:20,720

613
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,351

[music and singing] what you feel trying

616
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,240
to do.

617
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:34,796
Leaving it on your daily in the [music]

618
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:38,640
pain inside me. It's enough to leave me

619
00:38:34,796 --> 00:38:42,320
[music and singing] crying in the rain.

620
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:46,586
Love forever, [music] but you drive me

621
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,280

622

623
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,280

649
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,482

You are the reason [singing] for my

lover and my sorrow.

652
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:24,182
Blow up the cave. [singing] The light

653
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,160
will burn again tomorrow.

654
00:40:24,182 --> 00:40:29,920

What am I going to do if we lose that

669
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:09,440

00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,200

Baby, [music] I can take my time.

00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:34,640
heat between your legs.

691
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:38,720
You've been scared of love [music]

692
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:40,800
and what it did to you. You don't have

693
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,839

And you look like you're just my type.

00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:06,000
See, you're the kind, you're the kind

752
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:11,040
whose [music] spirits are running free.

753
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:15,922
Let's take a sip of [music] co wine and

754
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:18,880
dance to the music nice and slow.

755
00:46:15,922 --> 00:46:21,839
[music] You won't [singing] be under any

756
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:24,960
kind of pressure. You see, [music] we'll

757
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:29,760

Come off to my [music] place.

just bored to death and you want to get

764
00:46:53,257 --> 00:46:59,359
[singing] away. You want to get away

765
00:46:55,839 --> 00:47:03,839
from this noise and the crowd. [music]

766
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:05,702
Let's go where it's nice and quiet where

767
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:06,319

else around.

770
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:14,640
Let's sit by a [singing and music] cozy

771
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,837
lit fire

772
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,520
and we can be in each other's

773
00:47:16,837 --> 00:47:20,000

774
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:24,800
company.

775
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:27,680
Now, how does that sound to you? You

Don't you do that to me.

[music]

803
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:32,800
Love hurts.

804
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,754
Love [singing] scars.

805
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,754
Love wounds. [music]

806
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:41,359
It marks

807
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:44,160
any [singing] heart.

808
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:47,119
Not [music] tough.

809
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,720
Oh, [singing] strong

810
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:50,720
enough

811
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:54,720
to take [music and singing] a lot of

812
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:57,969
pain. Take good of me.

813
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,989
Love is [singing] like a cloud holding.

814
00:49:57,969 --> 00:49:59,989
[music]

815
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,680
Love hurts.

816
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,359
Love [singing and music] hurts.

817
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:18,760
I'm young.

818
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,760
I [singing and music] know.

819
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:26,640
even

820
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:29,359
so I [music] know one thing

821
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:32,000
or [singing] two [music]

822
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:36,614
I've learned

823
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,200
from you I really learn

824
00:50:36,614 --> 00:50:40,400
[music]

825
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:43,819
really love

826
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:46,480
is like a flame it burns you when

827
00:50:43,819 --> 00:50:49,880
[music and singing] it's hard

828
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,880
Love hurts.

829
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,480
Love hurts.

830
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:05,490
Some think of happiness

831
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:05,490
[music]

832
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,680
togetherness.

833
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:13,359
[music]

834
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:15,260
My fools hold themselves

835
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:16,640
against

836
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:20,920
[music]

837
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,920
falling me.

838
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:23,830
[music]

839
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,380
[music]

840
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:46,045
[music]

841
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:49,040
I know it isn't true. I know it isn't

842
00:51:46,045 --> 00:51:50,559
[music] true. Love [singing] is just a

843
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:54,000
lie

844
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:57,000
made to make you

845
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
love.

846
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:03,240
[music]

847
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,240
Love hurts.

848
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:08,920
Ooh,

849
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,920
love hurts.

850
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,591
Oh,

851
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,599
love [music]

852
00:52:11,591 --> 00:52:14,599
[singing] hurts.

853
00:52:21,416 --> 00:52:23,436
[music]

854
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:29,520
The palace you arrange in Sam. [singing]

855
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:33,359
They were strange. They speak [music] to

856
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:36,160
me like constellations as will I hear.

857
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:38,319
There's a magic I can hold. [music] Your

858
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:41,066
smile of hon. [singing]

859
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:44,319
And that you never seem to be in short

860
00:52:41,066 --> 00:52:46,960
[music] supply of you.

861
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:49,680
So baby, let's [singing] get it on.

862
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:54,240
Drinking wine and killing time. Sitting

863
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:57,920
in the summer [music] sun. You know I

864
00:52:54,240 --> 00:53:03,839
wanted you for long. Why [music] you

865
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:07,800
have to drop that phone on me? Lazy

866
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:07,800
days, crazy.

867
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:18,760
You [singing and music] say we've been

868
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:18,760
friends too long.

869
00:53:19,056 --> 00:53:21,076
[music]

870
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:26,559
Seven days in sunny June were long

871
00:53:24,297 --> 00:53:29,440
[music and singing] enough to bloom. The

872
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:31,040
flowers on the summer dress you wore the

873
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,440
spring

874
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:36,640
the way [music and singing] we laugh

875
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:38,480
and then you drop the ball that I know

876
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:41,920
you too long for us [music and singing]

877
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:45,520
have you.

878
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:47,599
So baby let's get it all. Drinking wine

879
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,440
and killing time. [music] Sitting in

880
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:54,240
sun.

881
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:58,480
You know I wanted you [music] alone.

882
00:53:54,240 --> 00:54:01,280
Why [singing] you have to drop that bomb

883
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:05,520
on me? Could it resist the [music]

884
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:08,160
stories in your eyes? Turn off wings.

885
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:11,457
You fly away on

886
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:14,400
seven days in June. Long enough

887
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:18,000
[singing] to bloom. The flowers on the

888
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:19,680
summer dress you warm this spring. Yeah.

889
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:24,119
Yeah. [music]

890
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:24,119
The way we laugh this one.

891
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:30,000
Why did [music] you drop the bomb

892
00:54:27,177 --> 00:54:32,559
[singing] on my shoes?

893
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,359
So baby, [music] let's get it all.

894
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:37,440
Drinking wine and killing time sitting

895
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:42,319
in sun.

896
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:45,760
You know I want to use it all. [music]

897
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:48,792
Why you have to drop that [singing]

898
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,720
bomb? Could it be this? The honey stock

899
00:54:48,792 --> 00:54:54,079
[music] of bliss and you seem to show

900
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:57,599
me. Could it be this? Cuz seven days in

901
00:54:54,079 --> 00:55:00,079
June, it wasn't lonely. Could be this.

902
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:03,119
You never [music] give me time to say I

903
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:05,200
love you. Could be this. I know you

904
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:06,800
don't believe me, but [music] it's so

905
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,753
true.

906
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:13,520
Walk away from me, girl. I read the

907
00:55:09,753 --> 00:55:13,520
[music] stories in your eyes.

908
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:20,480
Don't you walk away from me. Yeah. Yeah.

909
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,400
I read the stories in [singing] your

910
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,480
eyes.

911
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:28,359
You've been telling me we were friends

912
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:28,359
for too long. Yeah.

913
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:33,599
I think I love you.

914
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:39,938
I think I [music] love you. Why you have

915
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:39,938
to drop on my way? Yeah. Yeah. [music]

916
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Oo.

917
00:55:43,813 --> 00:55:45,833

[music]

921
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:10,480
It might seem crazy what I'm about

922
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:13,040
[music] to say. Sunshine, she's here.

923
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,559
You can take a break.

924
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:17,680
Hotter balloon [singing]

925
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:22,160
going up to space [music]

926
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:24,423

00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:39,200
feel like a room without a roof. Cuz I'm

931
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:43,280
happy. Clap along if you feel like

932
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:47,520
happiness is the truth.

933
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:51,680

for survival

980
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:47,040
underneath the stars where we

993
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:31,359
When we see the lights [music]

995
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:37,119

01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:21,852
I'm going back down south. [music]

1009
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:26,880
Come take my hand.

1010
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:29,599
I'm [music] going [singing] back down

1011
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:32,987
south. Now

1012
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:32,987
when we see the lights [music]

1013
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:37,559
and we [singing]

1014
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:37,559

1015
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:42,000
I'm [music] going back down south now.

1016
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:47,000
I'm [singing]

1017
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,000

1018
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,637
I'm going [singing] back down. [music]

1019
01:02:03,717 --> 01:02:05,737
[music]

1020
01:02:15,507 --> 01:02:17,527
[music]

1021
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:28,920
More red [music and singing] and more.

1022
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:28,920
You're kissing like a halfopen door.

1023
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:36,079
I [music] can't [singing] get in.

1024
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:38,559
You stop me just before I begin.

1025
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:40,720
And it [singing] hurts to [music] be in

1026
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:44,400
love

1027
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:45,920
when you never get enough.

1028
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:49,960
Oh, it hurts [singing and music]

1029
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,960
to be in love.

1030
01:02:52,188 --> 01:02:54,208
[music]

1031
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:59,119
The sun blue search

1032
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:02,680
keeps my body [music and singing] right

1033
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:02,680
on the verge.

1034
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:09,680
touching them. [music]

1035
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:12,000
I want to do it over again.

1036
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:13,839
And it hurts to be [music and singing]

1037
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:18,079
in love

1038
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:22,973
when you only half as much.

1039
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:23,839
Oh, it hurts to be in love.

1040
01:03:22,973 --> 01:03:26,960
[music]

1041
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:32,119
I'm always [singing] worried.

1042
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:32,119
You think [music] I'm pushing too hard.

1043
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:36,799
Oh, baby, it hurts me

1044
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:42,119
when it's all I'm [music and singing]

1045
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:42,119
going too far

1046
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:49,884
and [music]

1047
01:03:53,599 --> 01:04:00,240
touching. [music]

1048
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:04,319
want to do it over again.

1049
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:07,039
And it hurts to be in love

1050
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:08,640
when you [music] only want me half as

1051
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:11,119
much.

1052
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:13,119
Oh, it hurts to be [music and singing]

1053
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:17,200
love.

1054
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:20,200
You only want me half as much.

1055
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:20,200
Oh.

1056
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:25,079
Oh, baby, it hurts.

1057
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,599

You got a hold of me.

1062
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:01,599
As long as I got [singing] your love,

1063
01:04:57,294 --> 01:05:03,859
[music] you know that I'll never leave.

1064
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:05,359
When I wanted you to share my life,

1065
01:05:03,859 --> 01:05:09,039
[singing and music]

1066
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:11,760

I've lived the mark [music] of me.

You've been constant [singing] as a

01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:42,240
northern star.

1077
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:45,520

01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:47,200
and it's for you.

1079
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:51,005

[music]

1091
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:25,280
Through

1092
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:27,030
my darkest night,

1093
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:29,280

1094
01:06:27,030 --> 01:06:33,520

1095
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:36,856
You brought me into the light.

1096
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:40,319
Threw away all those crazy dreams.

1097
01:06:36,856 --> 01:06:44,039
[music] I put them all behind.

1098
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:44,039
And it [singing] was you

1099
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:50,119

If I should doubt myself,

01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:25,599
I'm [music] only [singing] losing

1110
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:27,839
ground.

1111
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:29,359
I won't turn to someone [music]

1112
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:33,599

1113
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:35,920

When I wanted you to share my [singing]

Your love is sweet [music] misery.

1310
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:19,840

Now there's [singing] not even breathing

1316
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:35,199
room

1317
01:19:31,074 --> 01:19:37,199
[music] between pleasure and pain.

1318
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:40,960

Takes my breath away. [singing]

is never sing your kiss.

1332
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:27,679
If our love goes up in

1333
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:30,400
[music and singing] flames, it's a fire

1334
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:34,640
I can't resist.

1335
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:39,840
I was [music] crying when I met you. Now

1336
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:42,400
I'm trying to forget you.

Misery. [music]

1339
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:55,920

down on me.

1343
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:08,199
It's not [music] even breathing room.

1344
01:21:15,221 --> 01:21:17,241
[music]

1345
01:21:21,771 --> 01:21:26,159
[music]

1346
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:28,321
It was way past midnight

1347
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:33,000
and she still

1348
01:21:28,321 --> 01:21:33,000
[music] couldn't fall asleep.

1349
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:38,880
This night the dream [music and singing]

1350
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:43,441
was leaving.

1351
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:43,441
She tried so hard to keep. [music]

1352
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:49,560
And with a new day, darling,

1353
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:54,576
she felt they drift away. [music]

1354
01:21:55,760 --> 01:22:03,719
Not only for a cruise,

1355
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:03,719
not only for [music and singing] a day.

1356
01:22:07,621 --> 01:22:09,641
[music]

1357
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:23,120
Too long [singing and music] ago, too

1358
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:25,306
long aart, she couldn't wait another day

1359
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:26,320
for

1360
01:22:25,306 --> 01:22:31,080
[music]

1361
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:31,080
the captain of her heart.

1362
01:22:31,201 --> 01:22:33,221
[music]

1363
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:44,719
As [music] the day came up, she made a

1364
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:48,287
stop. She stopped waiting for another

1365
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:48,287
day for [music]

1366
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:54,837
the captain of her heart.

1367
01:22:52,817 --> 01:22:54,837
[music]

1368
01:23:00,677 --> 01:23:02,697
[music]

1369
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:11,212
[music]

1370
01:23:23,602 --> 01:23:26,880
[music]

1371
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:29,552
And with the new

1372
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:29,552
days, [singing]

1373
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:35,719
she felt [music] they drift away.

1374
01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:39,840
Not only [music and singing] for a

1375
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:43,907
cruise,

1376
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:45,927
not only for a day,

1377
01:23:43,907 --> 01:23:45,927
[music]

1378
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:55,080
too long ago, too long a fall. She

1379
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:55,080
couldn't wait another day for

1380
01:23:55,600 --> 01:24:01,600
the captain of her own. As the day came

1381
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:06,600
up, she made a stop. She [music] stopped

1382
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:06,600
waiting for another day for

1383
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:11,120
the captain of her heart.

1384
01:24:10,108 --> 01:24:14,440
[music]

1385
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:14,440
Her heart.

1386
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:23,320
The captain [music and singing]

1387
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:23,320
of her heart.

1388
01:24:26,483 --> 01:24:28,503
[music]

1389
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:36,159
As the day came [music] up, she made a

1390
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:40,679
stop. She stopped waiting [singing]

1391
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:40,679
another day for

1392
01:24:40,893 --> 01:24:46,360
[music] the captain of [singing] her

1393
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:46,360
heart.

1394
01:24:48,098 --> 01:24:52,738
[music] The captain of her heart.

1395
01:24:50,718 --> 01:24:52,738
[singing]

1396
01:24:55,958 --> 01:25:00,440
[music]

1397
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,440
Heaven of her heart.

1398
01:25:01,853 --> 01:25:03,873
[music]

1399
01:25:19,538 --> 01:25:21,558
[music]

1400
01:25:25,434 --> 01:25:27,454
[music]

1401
01:25:33,948 --> 01:25:35,969
[music]

1402
01:25:41,154 --> 01:25:44,480
[music]

1403
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:47,600
Turn your magic on

1404
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:49,600
me. She'd [singing] say

1405
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:52,239
everything [music] you want. So dream

1406
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:54,960
away.

1407
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:57,360
And we are legends [music]

1408
01:25:54,960 --> 01:26:00,804
every day. [singing]

1409
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:02,400
That's what she told me.

1410
01:26:00,804 --> 01:26:04,960
[music]

1411
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:08,064
Turn your magic on

1412
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:08,064
to me. She'd say [singing]

1413
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:12,960
everything [music] you want to dream

1414
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:14,559
away.

1415
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,360
Under this pressure, [singing]

1416
01:26:14,559 --> 01:26:18,320
[music]

1417
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:21,280
under this weight,

1418
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:25,094
we are diamonds. I feel my [singing]

1419
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:25,094
heart beaten. [music]

1420
01:26:25,199 --> 01:26:31,280
I feel my heart underneath

1421
01:26:28,314 --> 01:26:35,440
[singing and music] my skin. Oh, I feel

1422
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:40,000

1423
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:44,679
Oh, you make [singing] me feel [music]

1424
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,679
like I'm alive again.

1425
01:26:48,619 --> 01:26:50,639
[music]

1426
01:26:54,239 --> 01:27:00,000
Say can go on

1427
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:01,360
not in this way.

1428
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,639
I'm a dream to die [music and singing]

1429
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:07,280
by light of day.

1430
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:09,580
Going to hold above

1431
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:13,510
the sky and say [singing]

1432
01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:14,080

[singing]

1434
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:17,120
beating.

1435
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:20,800
[music]

1436
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:24,560
I feel my heart underneath [singing] my

1437
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:27,320
skin. Oh, I feel my [music] heart

1438
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,320
beating. [singing]

1439
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:31,800
You make me feel

1440
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,600
like I'm [music and singing] alive

1441
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,600
again.

1442
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,420
[music]

1443
01:27:50,190 --> 01:27:52,210
[music]

1444
01:27:56,085 --> 01:27:59,360
[music]

1445
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:02,480
Turn your magic [singing] on

1446
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:03,946

1447
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:06,960

01:28:03,946 --> 01:28:09,520
[singing] dream away.

1449
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:11,151
Under this pressure,

1450
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:12,480
under this weight. [singing]

1451
01:28:11,151 --> 01:28:17,679
[music]

1452
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:23,159
We are diamonds taking shape.

1453
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:23,159
We are diamonds taking shape.

1454
01:28:30,801 --> 01:28:32,821
[music]

1455
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:48,679

[music and singing] wanted to dance.

1517
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:01,520
They're looking for a little romance

1518
01:33:00,664 --> 01:33:03,199
[music]

1519
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:06,440

01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:16,159
All the [singing] highlights in your

1524
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:19,004
hair that catch [music] your eyes.

1525
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:23,719

01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:34,880
Chicken. [music]

1530
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:37,880
There's nobody [singing]

1531
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:37,880
here.

1532
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:44,480
It's just you [music and singing] and

1533
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:47,760

1534
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:49,120

1537
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:59,239
But there's beauty by my side.

1538
01:33:59,614 --> 01:34:05,510
[music]

1539
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:07,199

1544
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:30,239

1546

01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:38,970
You were amazing. [music]

1548
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:44,480
I never see so many people want to

1549
01:34:41,535 --> 01:34:48,560
[singing] be there by your side. [music]

1550
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:52,440
And when you turn me and smile, you took

1551
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:52,440
my breath away.

1552
01:34:53,199 --> 01:34:59,760
And I never [music and singing] had such

1553
01:34:54,880 --> 01:35:02,880
a feeling such a feeling of complete and

1554
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:06,159
utter [music and singing] love

1555
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:10,440
as I do tonight.

1556
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:10,440
Lady of red

1557
01:35:12,321 --> 01:35:17,600

01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:20,080

1559
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:21,520
Cheek to [music] cheek.

1560
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:24,320
There's nobody [singing]

1561
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:24,320
here.

1562
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:30,716
It's just you and me. [music]

1563
01:35:31,199 --> 01:35:38,760
It's where I want [singing] to be.

1564
01:35:33,936 --> 01:35:38,760
[music] But I hardly know.

1565
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:47,120
This beauty by my side.

1566
01:35:45,726 --> 01:35:52,276
[music]

1567
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:53,920
Give you I'll never forget

1568
01:35:52,276 --> 01:35:57,600
[music]

1569
01:35:53,920 --> 01:36:00,136
the way you look

1570
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:01,446
tonight.

1571
01:36:00,136 --> 01:36:03,466
[music]

1572
01:36:01,446 --> 01:36:03,466
[singing]

1573
01:36:13,891 --> 01:36:15,911
[music]

1574
01:36:23,716 --> 01:36:25,736
[music]

1575
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:34,400
He had no [singing] time to regret.

1576
01:36:32,886 --> 01:36:39,436
[music]

1577
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:43,800
He kept his dick wet with his same old

1578
01:36:39,436 --> 01:36:43,800
[music] safe bed.

1579
01:36:44,239 --> 01:36:51,360

1581
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:59,797
and my [music and singing] tears dry.

1582
01:36:54,639 --> 01:36:59,797
Get on without my eyes. [music]

1583
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:07,840
And you

1584
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:11,040
went [music] back to what you known.

1585
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:16,840
So far removed [music]

1586
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:16,840
from all [singing] that we went through.

1587
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:24,320
And I [music and singing]

1588
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:28,000
tread the trouble track.

1589
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:33,400
My [music] odds are stacked.

1590
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:33,400
I go back [music] to black.

1591
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:41,199
We only said goodbye [music]

1592
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:43,520
with [singing] words. I died a 100

1593
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:46,320
times.

You [singing] go back to her [music] and

land.

1631
01:40:22,139 --> 01:40:24,159
[music]

1632
01:40:28,034 --> 01:40:33,929
[music]

1633
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:35,949
I thought that I [singing] was over you.

1634
01:40:33,929 --> 01:40:35,949
[music]

1635
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:40,199
How I was mistaken?

1636
01:40:42,444 --> 01:40:47,684
[music] Why did I [singing] bump into

1637
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:49,199
you

1638
01:40:47,684 --> 01:40:54,119
[music]

1639
01:40:49,199 --> 01:40:54,119
and start this change reaction?

1640
01:40:56,320 --> 01:41:00,840
I felt a building up inside. [music]

1641
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:07,600
When [music]

1642
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:09,954
suddenly,

1643
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:13,159
oh was more that I can

1644
01:41:09,954 --> 01:41:13,159
[music and singing] bear.

1645
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:20,040
More than [singing] I can bear

1646
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:25,074
when I saw you [music]

1647
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:31,880
walking [singing] down the road with

1648
01:41:28,239 --> 01:41:31,880
someone new.

1649
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:38,480
I could believe [music and singing] it.

1650
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:42,679
It was true.

1651
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:42,679
Oh, [music] it was true.

1652
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:49,880
I find it hard [music] to sleep at

1653
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:49,880
night.

1654
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:56,600
This [music] jealousy is burning

1655
01:41:53,185 --> 01:41:56,600
[singing] bright.

1656
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:04,375
Visions of some else

1657
01:42:02,355 --> 01:42:04,375
[music]

1658
01:42:05,199 --> 01:42:09,615
torments me to distraction. [music]

1659
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:16,000
I think [music] of him

1660
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:20,679

1661
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,679
love to you.

1662
01:42:21,199 --> 01:42:23,370
More. [music]

1663
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:28,611
It was more than I can bear. [music]

1664
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:35,160
It was more than I can bear. [music]

1665
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:40,520
Oh [singing] yeah, girl.

1666
01:42:41,199 --> 01:42:47,239
Walking down the road

1667
01:42:42,966 --> 01:42:47,239
[music and singing] with someone new.

1668
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:57,719
I can believe that [music] it was true.

1669
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:57,719
It was true.

1670
01:43:07,856 --> 01:43:09,876
[music]

1671
01:43:15,716 --> 01:43:17,736
[music]

1672
01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:29,199
Oh, when I saw you

1673
01:43:27,119 --> 01:43:33,520
then I

1674
01:43:29,199 --> 01:43:33,520
walking [music] down the road with

1675
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:38,000
I [music]

1676
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:41,261
couldn't believe [singing]

1677
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:41,920
it was true.

1678
01:43:41,261 --> 01:43:45,040
[music]

1679
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:49,177
It was true.

1680
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:49,177
When I saw you [music]

1681
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:55,159
walking down the road with someone,

1682
01:43:56,480 --> 01:44:02,480
I couldn't believe [music and singing]

1683
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:05,840
it. This was true.

1684
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:09,239
It was true.

1685
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:09,239
Yeah. Yeah.

1686
01:44:21,872 --> 01:44:23,892
[music]

1687
01:44:24,159 --> 01:44:29,132
For your [singing] love.

1688
01:44:27,112 --> 01:44:29,132
[music]

1689
01:44:31,119 --> 01:44:37,400
When I think about [music and singing]

1690
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:37,400
those nights in Montreal,

1691
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:44,600
I get the sweetest [music] thoughts of

1692
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:44,600
you and me.

1693
01:44:44,797 --> 01:44:47,360
[music]

1694
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:52,960
Memories [singing]

1695
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:56,639
of love above the city lights.

1696
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:57,920
Ooh, I [music] try so hard to take it,

1697
01:44:56,639 --> 01:45:01,172
but alone [singing]

1698
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:04,880
my heart will make it.

1699
01:45:01,172 --> 01:45:07,520
[music] I [singing] just want to stop it

1700
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:12,560
and say what I feel [music] about you,

1701
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:13,679
babe. I just want to stop

1702
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:18,320
and never [music and singing] want to

1703
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:20,800
leave without you, babe. I just got to

1704
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:24,159
stop

1705
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:24,159
for your [singing and music] life.

1706
01:45:27,372 --> 01:45:29,392
[music]

1707
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:37,320
When I think about the way

1708
01:45:33,267 --> 01:45:37,320
[music and singing] the world was hurt,

1709
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:43,960
I get the [music] saddest thoughts of

1710
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:43,960
for you and me.

1711
01:45:45,058 --> 01:45:49,600
[music]

1712
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:52,320
Memories of life and time goes on and

1713
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:56,000
on.

1714
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:58,880
Ooh, [music] I try hard to forget it,

1715
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:00,719
but oh Lord, my heart will make [music]

1716
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:04,159
it.

1717
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:06,800
I just [singing] want to stop

1718
01:46:04,159 --> 01:46:11,840
and say what I feel about [music] you,

1719
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:13,520
babe. I just want to stop

1720
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:15,188
and never want [singing] to leave

1721
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:15,600
without you, babe.

1722
01:46:15,188 --> 01:46:20,159
[music]

1723
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:24,413
I just got to stop

1724
01:46:20,159 --> 01:46:24,413
for your love. [singing]

1725
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:42,920
One of these nights.

1726
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:48,440
One of these crazy old nights

1727
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:53,440
we're going to find out, [music] pretty

1728
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:57,880
mama.

1729
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:57,880
What turns on your lights?

1730
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:04,000
The full moon is calling. The fever is

1731
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:08,159
high. And the wicked [singing and music]

1732
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:10,800
wind whispers and moans.

1733
01:47:08,159 --> 01:47:17,960
You got your [music] demons, you got

1734
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:17,960
your desires. But I got a few of my own.

1735
01:47:18,069 --> 01:47:22,639
[music]

1736
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:25,920
Someone to [singing] be kind to in

1737
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:29,360
between the dark and the light.

1738
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:32,000
Oh, you

1739
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:34,880
coming right [music] behind you. Swear

1740
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,360
I'm going to find you. One of these

1741
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:39,320
nights, [music]

1742
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:39,320
one of these dreams.

1743
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:45,280
One of these lost [music] and lonely

1744
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:49,564
dreams.

1745
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:49,564
We're going to find one. [music]

1746
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:54,280
One that really screams.

1747
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:59,920
I've been searching for the [music]

1748
01:47:56,400 --> 01:48:02,609
daughter of the devil himself. I've been

1749
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:04,080
searching for an angel in white.

1750
01:48:02,609 --> 01:48:07,040
[singing and music]

1751
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:09,920
I've been waiting for a woman who's a

1752
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:14,119
little of both. I can feel a [music]

1753
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:14,119
meshes nowhere inside.

1754
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:20,239
Loneliness will find you

1755
01:48:18,329 --> 01:48:22,400
[music and singing] in between the wrong

1756
01:48:20,239 --> 01:48:25,400
and the right.

1757
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:25,400
Oh,

1758
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:31,429
coming [music] right behind you. Swear

1759
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:34,440
I'm going to find you one of these

1760
01:48:31,429 --> 01:48:34,440
[music] nights.

1761
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:55,720
One of these nights

1762
01:48:53,700 --> 01:48:55,720
[music]

1763
01:48:56,480 --> 01:49:00,320
in between the dark and the light.

1764
01:48:58,940 --> 01:49:04,080
[music]

1765
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:07,280
I'll come right behind you. Sir, I'm

1766
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:09,440
going to find you. [music] One of these

1767
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:13,480
nights.

1768
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:13,480
One of these nights.

1769
01:49:14,159 --> 01:49:17,159
Oh,

1770
01:49:18,590 --> 01:49:22,920
[music] one of [singing] these nights.

1771
01:49:25,795 --> 01:49:27,815
[music]

1772
01:49:28,239 --> 01:49:32,960
One of these [singing] nights.

1773
01:49:31,690 --> 01:49:36,330
[music]

1774
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:36,330
Oh, [singing]

1775
01:49:36,930 --> 01:49:41,719
[music]

1776
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:41,719
one of these nights.

1777
01:49:47,410 --> 01:49:49,430
[music and singing]

1778
01:49:58,546 --> 01:50:00,566
[music]

1779
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:12,920
We [music] both lie silently still in

1780
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:12,920
the dead of the night.

1781
01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:17,840
Although we [music] both [singing] lie

1782
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:19,506
closer together with the miles apart

1783
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:21,199
inside.

1784
01:50:19,506 --> 01:50:24,560
[music] Was it something I [singing]

1785
01:50:21,199 --> 01:50:27,520
said or something I did? Did my words

1786
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:33,199
don't come out right? [music] Though I

1787
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:35,881
try not to hurt you. Though I try, but I

1788
01:50:33,199 --> 01:50:36,719
guess that's what they say. Every

1789
01:50:35,881 --> 01:50:37,840
[music]

1790
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:41,480
rose [singing]

1791
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:41,480
has its throne.

1792
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:48,840
Just like [music] every night [singing]

1793
01:50:45,199 --> 01:50:48,840
has its throne.

1794
01:50:49,119 --> 01:50:55,040
Just like [music] every

1795
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:57,440
cowboy sings his head

1796
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:58,880
song, [music]

1797
01:50:57,440 --> 01:51:03,639
every [singing]

1798
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:03,639
rose has its thong.

1799
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:11,400
I listen to a [music] favorite song

1800
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:11,400
playing on the radio.

1801
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:18,639
The DJ [music and singing] say he loves

1802
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:20,560
a game of is it come easy go?

1803
01:51:18,639 --> 01:51:24,639
But I wonder, [music and singing]

1804
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:26,080
does he know, has he ever felt like

1805
01:51:24,639 --> 01:51:28,937
this? [music]

1806
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:30,880
And I know that you'll be here right

1807
01:51:28,937 --> 01:51:35,360
[singing] now. If I can [music] let you

1808
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:40,599
know somehow, I guess

1809
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:40,599
every rose has its [music] throne.

1810
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:47,960
Just like every night [singing]

1811
01:51:44,239 --> 01:51:47,960
has its [music] stone.

1812
01:51:48,239 --> 01:51:51,840
Just like every

1813
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:54,159
cowboy [music]

1814
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:56,480
sings his head

1815
01:51:54,159 --> 01:51:59,679
song,

1816
01:51:56,480 --> 01:52:02,679
every [music and singing] rose has his

1817
01:51:59,679 --> 01:52:02,679
song.

1818
01:52:04,159 --> 01:52:08,960
Though [music and singing] it's been a

1819
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:11,520
while now, I can still feel so much

1820
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:13,477
pain.

1821
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:15,679
Like a knife that catch you the

1822
01:52:13,477 --> 01:52:17,280
[music and singing] moon heels. But the

1823
01:52:15,679 --> 01:52:20,027
scar

1824
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:21,440
the scar remain.

1825
01:52:20,027 --> 01:52:24,440
[music] Yeah. [singing]

1826
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:24,440
Yeah.

1827
01:52:29,852 --> 01:52:31,872
[music]

1828
01:52:47,679 --> 01:52:52,719
I know [music] I could have saved a love

1829
01:52:50,159 --> 01:52:56,080
that night [singing] if I known just

1830
01:52:52,719 --> 01:53:00,639
what to say. Instead of [music] making

1831
01:52:56,080 --> 01:53:02,159
love, we both made up several [singing]

1832
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:05,040
ways.

1833
01:53:02,159 --> 01:53:07,760
And now I [music] hear you find somebody

1834
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:11,773
new and that I never meant [singing]

1835
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:13,760
that much to you. To hear that tears me

1836
01:53:11,773 --> 01:53:17,760
[music] deep inside. [singing] And to

1837
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:20,320
see you cut me like a knife. I guess

1838
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:24,480
every [music] rose [singing]

1839
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:28,000
has its throne. Every rose has it. Just

1840
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:32,480
like every night [singing and music] has

1841
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:35,199
its stone. Every night has it.

1842
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:39,938
Every cowboy [singing and music]

1843
01:53:35,199 --> 01:53:44,400
sings a sad s song.

1844
01:53:39,938 --> 01:53:47,360
[music and singing] Every rose as it th

1845
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:49,920
it thorn.

1846
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:53,760
Every rose [music and singing]

1847
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:56,080
has its thorn. Every rose every rose.

1848
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:57,199
Just like every [music]

1849
01:53:56,080 --> 01:54:01,440
night [singing]

1850
01:53:57,199 --> 01:54:03,520
has its storm. Every night has it. Just

1851
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:09,440
like [music] every

1852
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:12,080
cowboy sings his headset [music] song,

1853
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:15,308
every rose [singing]

1854
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:17,328
as his song.

1855
01:54:15,308 --> 01:54:17,328
[music]

1856
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:25,119
Why do birds

1857
01:54:23,823 --> 01:54:28,119
[music] suddenly [singing]

1858
01:54:25,119 --> 01:54:28,119
appear

1859
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:31,679
every time?

1860
01:54:30,374 --> 01:54:35,159
[music]

1861
01:54:31,679 --> 01:54:35,159
You are near

01:54:35,614 --> 01:54:42,320
[music] just like me.

1863
01:54:39,119 --> 01:54:46,520
They long to be [music]

1864
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:46,520
close to you.

1865
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:55,159
Why do [music] stars

1866
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:55,159
fall down from the sky?

1867
01:54:55,199 --> 01:55:02,480
Every time

1868
01:54:58,239 --> 01:55:05,840
you walk by, you walk by.

1869
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:09,040
Just like [music and singing] me,

1870
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:12,349

1871
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:12,349
close to you. [music]

1872
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:22,119
On the [music] day that you were born,

1873
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:22,880
the angels got together and decided

1874
01:55:22,119 --> 01:55:28,440
[music]

1875
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:28,440
to create a dream come true.

1876
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:32,000
So there's wrinkled moon dust in your

1877
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:35,219
hair [music]

1878
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:38,520
of golden starlight in your eyes of

1879
01:55:35,219 --> 01:55:38,520
[singing] blue.

1880
01:55:40,719 --> 01:55:44,080
That is [music]

1881
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:48,400
why

1882
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:49,440

All around. All around.

1887
01:55:54,215 --> 01:55:59,199

1888
01:55:55,840 --> 01:56:02,400
Just like me.

[music]

1892
01:56:11,245 --> 01:56:13,265
[music]

1893
01:56:16,485 --> 01:56:18,505
[music]

1894
01:56:28,930 --> 01:56:30,950
[music]

1895
01:56:31,599 --> 01:56:34,679
Heat. Hey. Hey. Hey.

1896
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:42,685
On the [music] day that you were born,

1897
01:56:38,639 --> 01:56:45,440
the angels got together and decided

1898
01:56:42,685 --> 01:56:48,440
[singing] to create a dream [music] come

1899
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:48,440
true.

1900
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:55,199
So this wrinkled moon dust in your head

1901
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:58,440
of golden [music] starlight in your eyes

1902
01:56:55,199 --> 01:56:58,440
of blue.

1903
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:08,400
That is why [music]

1904
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:10,159
all the boys in town

1905
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:11,840

1906
01:57:10,159 --> 01:57:13,520
Follow you

1907
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:15,436
all around.

01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:15,840
All around.

1909
01:57:15,436 --> 01:57:19,199
[music]

1910
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:23,296
Just like me.

1911
01:57:19,199 --> 01:57:26,520
They long to be [music] close to

1912
01:57:23,296 --> 01:57:26,520
[singing] you.

1913
01:57:29,119 --> 01:57:35,679
Just like [music] me,

01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:39,880
they long [singing] to be

1915
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:39,880
close [music] to you.

1916
01:57:42,946 --> 01:57:44,966
[music]

1917
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:49,679
Close

1918
01:57:48,186 --> 01:57:53,239
[music]

1919
01:57:49,679 --> 01:57:53,239
to you.

1920
01:57:56,046 --> 01:57:58,066
[music]

1921
01:57:58,666 --> 01:58:00,686
[singing]

1922
01:58:01,941 --> 01:58:06,599
[music] Lost to you.

1923
01:58:20,281 --> 01:58:22,302
[music]

1924
01:58:25,521 --> 01:58:29,760
[music]

1925
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:33,840
Spirit [singing] of the sand.

1926
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:36,056
Oh, that's empty land where no one

1927
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:36,056
belongs. [music]

1928
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:45,172
And the blue [singing] get star

1929
01:58:41,119 --> 01:58:48,599
at the failing lights between moon and

1930
01:58:45,172 --> 01:58:48,599
[music] sun.

1931
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:56,159
In the desert fields,

1932
01:58:52,159 --> 01:58:59,159
a [music] fever so high makes me want to

1933
01:58:56,159 --> 01:58:59,159
shout.

1934
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:05,159
Sahara, [music] Sahara night.

1935
01:59:08,752 --> 01:59:10,772
[music]

1936
01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:21,760
Listen [music] to [singing] the wind

1937
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:24,760
bringing into your ears. Music from

1938
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:24,760
afar.

1939
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:29,119
You [music] may hear the sounds

1940
01:59:27,747 --> 01:59:32,000
[singing]

1941
01:59:29,119 --> 01:59:36,280
of a trial dance

1942
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:36,280
coming [music] from the heights

1943
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:45,432
in the [music and singing] desert field.

1944
01:59:40,239 --> 01:59:47,452
A fever so high makes me want to shout.

1945
01:59:45,432 --> 01:59:47,452
[music]

1946
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:52,280
Sahara sites.

1947
01:59:55,258 --> 01:59:57,278
[music]

1948
02:00:02,639 --> 02:00:09,760
and stars [music] screen the awful

1949
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:14,000
mystery of [singing] space

1950
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:16,800
with its [music] weight of fear.

1951
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:21,513
I now realize

1952
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:21,513
the hold it has on me. [music]

1953
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:30,028
D up.

1954
02:00:28,008 --> 02:00:30,028
[music]

1955
02:00:30,628 --> 02:00:34,613
[singing]

1956
02:00:32,593 --> 02:00:34,613
[music]

1957
02:00:42,418 --> 02:00:44,438
[music]

1958
02:00:48,639 --> 02:00:54,400
Sah night. [music]

1959
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:57,538
So nice.

1960
02:00:54,400 --> 02:00:57,538
So night. [music]

1961
02:01:02,723 --> 02:01:04,743
[music]

1962
02:01:21,719 --> 02:01:23,739
[music]

1963
02:01:29,578 --> 02:01:31,598
[music]

1964
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:40,714
I walk along the avenue.

1965
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:43,760
I [music] never thought I'd meet a girl

1966
02:01:40,714 --> 02:01:48,574
[singing] like you.

1967
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:49,920
meet a girl like you

1968
02:01:48,574 --> 02:01:53,920
[music]

1969
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:56,434
with auburn hair and tawny eyes.

1970
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:56,960
The kind [music] of eyes that hypnotize

1971
02:01:56,434 --> 02:01:59,440
[singing]

1972
02:01:56,960 --> 02:02:00,960

1973
02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:04,599
You hypnotize [music]

1974
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:04,599
me through

1975
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:12,440
and I ran.

1976
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:12,440
I ran so far away.

1977
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:20,000
I just [music] ran.

1978
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:22,634
I ran [singing] all night and day.

1979
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:24,654
I couldn't get away.

1980
02:02:22,634 --> 02:02:24,654
[music]

1981
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:41,920
A cloud appears [music and singing]

1982
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:45,599
above your head.

1983
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:47,679
A beam of light comes shining down on

1984
02:02:45,599 --> 02:02:52,599
you. [music]

1985
02:02:47,679 --> 02:02:52,599
Shining down on you.

1986
02:02:53,420 --> 02:02:58,000
[music] The cloud is moving near a

1987
02:02:56,239 --> 02:03:00,480
stealth.

1988
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:03,520
Aurora [music and singing] Borealis

1989
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:08,679
comes in view.

1990
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:08,679
Aurora comes in you.

1991
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:15,035
And I ran. [music]

1992
02:03:11,440 --> 02:03:16,719
I ran so far [singing] away.

1993
02:03:15,035 --> 02:03:19,440
[music]

1994
02:03:16,719 --> 02:03:23,920

[music]

1998
02:03:38,615 --> 02:03:40,635
[music]

1999
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:56,480
reached out [music] a hand to try again.

2000
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:59,440
I'm floating in [singing] a beam of

2001
02:03:56,480 --> 02:04:01,599
light with you.

2002
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:04,599
A beam [singing] of light with [music]

2003
02:04:01,599 --> 02:04:04,599
you.

2004
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:09,920
Reached out a [music] hand to touch your

2005
02:04:08,239 --> 02:04:12,400
face.

2006
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:15,440
You're slowly [singing] disappearing

2007
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:20,535
from my view. [music]

2008
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:23,440
Disappearing from my view.

2009
02:04:20,535 --> 02:04:28,360
[music] And I ran.

2010
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:28,360
I ran so [singing] far away.

2011
02:04:28,719 --> 02:04:33,599
I just ran.

2012
02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:36,599
I [music] ran all night [singing] and

2014
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:43,461
and I [music] ran.

2015
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:44,719
I ran so far away.

2016
02:04:43,461 --> 02:04:47,520
[music]

2018
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:55,199

02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:58,199
I couldn't get away.

[music]

2029
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:46,239
tension

2030
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:48,159
tension

2031
02:05:46,239 --> 02:05:51,880
between us [music and singing] just like

2032
02:05:48,159 --> 02:05:51,880
big fences.

2033
02:05:52,480 --> 02:05:58,320
You got [singing and music] issues that

02:17:30,319 --> 02:17:36,399
"Can I call you sometime?" [music]

2178
02:17:33,439 --> 02:17:39,644

[music]

2265
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:19,988
No one likes

02:22:16,720 --> 02:22:23,479

2267
02:22:19,988 --> 02:22:23,479

and I just can't [music] help myself.

2273
02:22:50,319 --> 02:22:55,479
And I just can't [singing] help [music]

2281

02:23:32,560 --> 02:23:36,624
cold.

2283
02:23:34,560 --> 02:23:39,920
Wouldn't help her if she didn't

[music and singing] I was walking you

2451
02:33:54,640 --> 02:34:01,501
home. We got down to the gate. I was

2452
02:33:57,680 --> 02:34:06,000
dreaming of the night.

2453
02:34:01,501 --> 02:34:07,600
[music] Would it turn out right?

I want to build my [singing] world

2459
02:34:15,257 --> 02:34:20,840
[music]

2460
02:34:16,319 --> 02:34:20,840
So you thought it's true.

02:34:21,280 --> 02:34:25,520
Want to make you understand. [singing]

2462
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:28,520
I'm talking [music] about a lifetime

2463
02:34:25,520 --> 02:34:28,520
plan.

2464
02:34:29,012 --> 02:34:32,399
[music]

2465
02:34:30,720 --> 02:34:35,600
That's the way to [singing] begin. were

2466
02:34:32,399 --> 02:34:39,546
hand in hand. Glenn Miller's band was a

2467
02:34:35,600 --> 02:34:39,546
better than before. [music]

2468
02:34:40,080 --> 02:34:44,399
We all [singing] scream for more.

2469
02:34:42,767 --> 02:34:48,007
[music]

2470
02:34:44,399 --> 02:34:49,280
And those B shoes

2471
02:34:48,007 --> 02:34:54,280
[music]

2472
02:34:49,280 --> 02:34:54,280
made us dance [singing] across the room.

2473
02:34:54,399 --> 02:34:59,160
It [music] ended up too soon.

2474
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:05,746
On the way back [singing] home, I

2475
02:35:01,840 --> 02:35:05,746
promise you never be alone. [music]

2476
02:35:09,120 --> 02:35:14,862
Hurry, don't [music and singing] be

2477
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:16,827
late. I can hardly wait. I said to

2478
02:35:14,862 --> 02:35:18,080
[singing] myself, when we're old,

2479
02:35:16,827 --> 02:35:21,600
[music]

2480
02:35:18,080 --> 02:35:23,040
we go dancing in the dark, walking

2481
02:35:21,600 --> 02:35:26,040
through the park and [music]

2482
02:35:23,040 --> 02:35:26,040
reminiscing.

2483
02:35:29,927 --> 02:35:31,946
[music]

2484
02:35:37,840 --> 02:35:41,359
Friday night, [music and singing] I was

2485
02:35:38,960 --> 02:35:44,479
late. I was walking it home. We got down

2486
02:35:41,359 --> 02:35:47,439
to the gate. I was dreaming of the

2487
02:35:44,479 --> 02:35:51,439
night. [music]

2488
02:35:47,439 --> 02:35:53,508
Would it turn out right?

2489
02:35:51,439 --> 02:35:55,527
Now's the [singing] years rollong.

2490
02:35:53,508 --> 02:35:55,527
[music]

2491
02:35:56,160 --> 02:36:03,333
It's time we hear a fair song.

2492
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:05,353
The memories come along.

2493
02:36:03,333 --> 02:36:05,353
[singing and music]

2494
02:36:06,720 --> 02:36:11,848
All the times we're missing. Spend the

2495
02:36:09,760 --> 02:36:13,867
hours reminiscing. [music]

2496
02:36:11,848 --> 02:36:13,867
[singing]

2497
02:36:16,319 --> 02:36:22,080
Hurry, don't be [music and singing]

2498
02:36:17,200 --> 02:36:25,619
late. I can hardly wait. I said to

2499
02:36:22,080 --> 02:36:28,240
myself when we're old. We go

2500
02:36:25,619 --> 02:36:30,240
[music and singing] dancing in the dark,

2501
02:36:28,240 --> 02:36:33,240
walking through the park and [music]

2502
02:36:30,240 --> 02:36:33,240
reminiscing.

2503
02:36:35,520 --> 02:36:41,323
Hurry, don't [music] be late. I can

2504
02:36:38,319 --> 02:36:42,080
hardly [singing] wait. I said to myself

2505
02:36:41,323 --> 02:36:45,908
[music]

2506
02:36:42,080 --> 02:36:48,640
when we're old, we go dancing in

2507
02:36:45,908 --> 02:36:52,439
[singing] the dark, walking through the

2508
02:36:48,640 --> 02:36:52,439
park and reminiscing.

2509
02:36:53,113 --> 02:36:55,133
[music]

2510
02:37:03,594 --> 02:37:05,613
[music]

2511
02:37:05,840 --> 02:37:13,560
Loving you

2512
02:37:07,840 --> 02:37:13,560
isn't [singing] the right thing to do.

2513
02:37:13,840 --> 02:37:21,319
How can I [singing]

2514
02:37:15,840 --> 02:37:21,319
ever [music] change things that I feel?

2515
02:37:21,840 --> 02:37:29,640
If [music] I could, maybe I'd give you

2516
02:37:25,863 --> 02:37:29,640
[singing] my world.

2517
02:37:29,760 --> 02:37:36,880
How can I when you won't take it from

2519
02:37:38,240 --> 02:37:42,800
You can go [music and singing] your own

2520
02:37:40,240 --> 02:37:46,169
way.

2521
02:37:42,800 --> 02:37:48,789
Go your own way.

turned around.

2531
02:38:09,760 --> 02:38:16,358

[music]

2558
02:40:05,686 --> 02:40:09,920
[snorts]

2559
02:40:06,560 --> 02:40:14,000
those walls I built?

2560
02:40:09,920 --> 02:40:17,840
Well, baby, they tumbling down.

2561
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:21,840
And they didn't even put up a fight

2562
02:40:17,840 --> 02:40:25,600
that didn't even make a sound.

2563
02:40:21,840 --> 02:40:30,080
I found a way to let you in,

2564
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:33,920
but I never really had a doubt.

2565
02:40:30,080 --> 02:40:37,840
Standing in the line of your hello.

2566
02:40:33,920 --> 02:40:41,680
I got my angel now.

It's like I've been awaken. [singing]

2568
02:40:41,680 --> 02:40:49,600
Every [music] rule I had to break it.

2569
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:53,920
It's the risk that I'm taking.

2570
02:40:49,600 --> 02:40:55,840
I never [music] going to shut you out.

2571
02:40:53,920 --> 02:40:57,520
But everywhere I'm [singing] looking

2572
02:40:55,840 --> 02:41:02,160
now,

2573
02:40:57,520 --> 02:41:05,840
I'm surrounded [music] by your embrace.

2574
02:41:02,160 --> 02:41:09,840
Baby, I can see your [singing] hello.

2575
02:41:05,840 --> 02:41:11,840
You know you're [music] my saving grace.

2576
02:41:09,840 --> 02:41:13,600
You're everything I need [singing] and

2577
02:41:11,840 --> 02:41:18,080

02:41:13,600 --> 02:41:20,356
It's written [music] all over your face,

2579
02:41:18,080 --> 02:41:22,080
baby. I can feel your hello.

2580
02:41:20,356 --> 02:41:26,680
[music and singing]

2581
02:41:22,080 --> 02:41:26,680
Pray it won't fade away.

2582
02:41:27,040 --> 02:41:31,040
