00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:38,120
found that the call him to speak is

91
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:38,120
often a vocation of Agony but we must

92
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:50,920
speak we must speak with all the

93
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:54,399
humility that is appropriate to our

94
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:57,720
limited Vision but we must

our nation's

00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:08,360
history that a significant number of its

99
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:12,199
religious leaders have chosen to move

100
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:15,680
beyond the prophesy of smooth patriotism

101
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:18,360
to The High Ground of a firm descent

102
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,680
based upon the mandates of conscience

103
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:25,440
and the reading of

104
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:27,160

106
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:35,120
us if it is let us Trace its

movements and pray that our own inner

108
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,199

109
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:44,000
