1842
02:07:50,239 --> 02:07:57,899

1844
02:07:58,400 --> 02:08:05,360
Rudolph the red nose reindeer

1845
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:09,679
had a very shiny nose.

1846
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:12,239
And if you ever saw it, you would even

1847
02:08:09,679 --> 02:08:15,520
say it glows.

Santa came to say,

1854
02:08:32,639 --> 02:08:39,920
"Rudolph, with your nose so bright,

1855
02:08:36,239 --> 02:08:43,679
won't you guide my sleigh tonight? And
